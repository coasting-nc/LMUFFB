I've generated one more sample of the Ratio Decidendi task and updated this report: docs\slide_decks\slides per prof Italiano, LLM consistency\consistency_report.txt

Please update docs\slide_decks\slides per prof Italiano, LLM consistency\slides TODO.md accordingly

I've updated `docs\slide_decks\slides per prof Italiano, LLM consistency\slides TODO.md` with the latest content from `consistency_report.txt`.

## User (2026-01-26 08:28:28)
In both the report docs\slide_decks\slides per prof Italiano, LLM consistency\slides TODO.md and the script "docs\slide_decks\slides per prof Italiano, LLM consistency\calculate_consistency_stats.py" that generates docs\slide_decks\slides per prof Italiano, LLM consistency\consistency_report.txt, in the table with SAMPLE DETAILS, please add a column with the number of the sample.

Note that in your last edit you deleted a large portion of the report, I had to restore it.

I have updated the Python script to include the "Sample #" column in the generated report.

Now, I will update the `slides TODO.md` file to match this new format in its markdown table.

In the table (both from the script and the TODO.md), add a column for the percentage of criteria of that sample that were scored as met for the reference solution (from REAL REASONING STATS, Criterion-level Met Rate).

Also reverse the order of the table: sample 1 should be the oldest.
