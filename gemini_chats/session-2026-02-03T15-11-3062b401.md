Your task is to answer the following question about Gemini CLI:
<question>
Can I use '--resume' to connect to a session that is still active in another terminal? What happens if I try to resume a session that hasn't been closed?
</question>

Based on the `cli/session-management.md` documentation:

The Gemini CLI automatically saves your session history, including conversation turns, tool executions, and token usage, to files located in `~/.gemini/tmp/<project_hash>/chats/`. Sessions are project-specific.

The documentation describes how to resume a session using the `--resume` flag or the `/resume` slash command, which loads a previously saved state of a session. It details that "Every time you interact with Gemini CLI, your session is automatically saved."

However, the provided documentation **does not explicitly state** what happens if you attempt to use `--resume` to connect to a session that is currently active in another terminal, or what happens if you try to resume a session that "hasn't been closed." The concept of a session needing to be "closed" is not mentioned; rather, sessions are automatically saved periodically.

Given that sessions are saved to disk, it can be inferred that resuming a session loads its state from these files. The documentation does not describe any locking mechanisms or conflict resolution for concurrent access to the same session files by multiple CLI instances. Therefore, the exact behavior in such a scenario (e.g., whether it would open a duplicate, lead to data inconsistencies, or cause an error) is not detailed in the available documentation.

You have stopped calling tools without finishing. You have one final chance to complete the task with a short grace period. You MUST call `complete_task` immediately with your best answer and explain that your investigation was interrupted. Do not call any other tools.
