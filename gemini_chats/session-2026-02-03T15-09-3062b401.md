I have another Gemini CLI session open in another terminal. However, it run into some errors. Therefore, I want to know if there is any command I can run to save the status of that chat, and / or the json of that chat, so it can be resumed later in a new Gemini CLI session.

Based on the documentation, there is no command to manually "save" or "export" the chat state as JSON. However, the Gemini CLI **automatically saves** your session in the background.

You can resume your previous session in a new terminal by running:

```powershell
gemini --resume
```

Or, if you are already inside the CLI, you can use:

```text
/resume
```

This will pick up right where you left off.

If the previous session has not been closed, but it is still open in a previous terminal, will "--resume" actually work?

The documentation doesn't explicitly mention a session "lock." Since the CLI saves state to disk (`~/.gemini/tmp/<project_hash>/chats/`) after every interaction, running `gemini --resume` in a second terminal should load the latest saved state.

However, be cautious:
- **State Inconsistency:** If both sessions are active, they might overwrite each other's history on disk since they are both writing to the same files.
- **Recommended Approach:** It's best to stop using the first terminal before resuming in the second. If the first one is frozen/errored, you can simply close it; the saved state on disk will still be available for the new session.
