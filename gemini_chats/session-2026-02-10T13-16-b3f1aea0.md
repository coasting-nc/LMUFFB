Your task is to do a deep investigation of the codebase to find all relevant files, code locations, architectural mental map and insights to solve  for the following user objective:
<objective>
Read and analyze the files in 'data/Kryptic_TMG_presets/Thrustmaster T300 Presets' and 'data/Kryptic_TMG_presets/release video transcript.md'. The goal is to compare the FFB presets for different GT3 cars and understand the user's tuning philosophy. I need to know the content of the .ini files and the markdown transcript.
</objective>

You have exceeded the maximum number of turns. You have one final chance to complete the task with a short grace period. You MUST call `complete_task` immediately with your best answer and explain that your investigation was interrupted. Do not call any other tools.
