Your task is to do a deep investigation of the codebase to find all relevant files, code locations, architectural mental map and insights to solve  for the following user objective:
<objective>
Investigate src/FFBEngine.h around lines 909 and 925. The user reported "warning C4723: potential divide by 0". I need to see the code to fix it. Please return the relevant code snippets and an analysis of why it might be dividing by zero.
</objective>

You have exceeded the time limit. You have one final chance to complete the task with a short grace period. You MUST call `complete_task` immediately with your best answer and explain that your investigation was interrupted. Do not call any other tools.
