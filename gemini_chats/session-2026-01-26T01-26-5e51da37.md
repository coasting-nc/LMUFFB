Your task is to answer the following question about Gemini CLI:
<question>
I updated `settings.json` with `"gemini.autoAccept": true`, but I still have to manually approve edits. Do I need to restart the session or do something else? Does this setting apply to the VS Code extension or the CLI running in the terminal?
</question>

The setting you are referring to is actually named `tools.autoAccept`, not `gemini.autoAccept`. You should update your `settings.json` file to use the correct key:

```json
"tools.autoAccept": true
```

Even with `tools.autoAccept` set to `true`, the Gemini CLI will only automatically accept and execute tool calls that are considered *safe* (e.g., read-only operations). Edits or other actions that are not classified as safe will still require your manual approval for security reasons.

Regarding your other questions:
1.  **Restart the session:** While not explicitly stated that a restart is strictly required, changes to the `settings.json` file are typically applied when the Gemini CLI session is started or reloaded. It's good practice to restart your Gemini CLI session to ensure the updated setting is recognized and applied.
2.  **Applies to VS Code extension or CLI:** The `settings.json` file and the `tools.autoAccept` setting it contains are configurations for the Gemini CLI itself. These settings govern the behavior of the CLI when it's running in your terminal. While a VS Code extension might integrate with the Gemini CLI, this specific setting directly controls the CLI's tool execution policy.

You have stopped calling tools without finishing. You have one final chance to complete the task with a short grace period. You MUST call `complete_task` immediately with your best answer and explain that your investigation was interrupted. Do not call any other tools.
