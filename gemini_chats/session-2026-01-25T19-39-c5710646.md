## Info (2026-01-25 19:39:59)
Installing IDE companion...

---

## Error (2026-01-25 19:39:59)
agy not found. Please ensure it is in your system's PATH.

## User (2026-01-25 19:41:03)
I keep getting this message when I start Gemini CLI: "ℹ Installing IDE companion...
✕ agy not found. Please ensure it is in your
  system's PATH."

I have installed the Gemini CLI companion on the IDE and reatarted the IDE, but this issue is persistent.

---

## Gemini (2026-01-25 19:41:19)
This issue usually means the CLI can't find the IDE companion's `agy` executable in your system's PATH. I can help you find it and fix the configuration.

---

## Gemini (2026-01-25 19:41:47)
It seems there was an issue with the help agent. I'll handle this directly.

The "agy not found" error means the `agy` executable for the IDE companion isn't in your system's PATH. I'll search your user directory to find `agy.exe` and then guide you on how to add it to your PATH.

---

## Gemini (2026-01-25 19:41:51)
I can't search for `agy.exe` outside of your project folder for security reasons. Could you please search for it on your computer?

Here's how you can do it on Windows:
1.  Open **File Explorer**.
2.  Navigate to **This PC**.
3.  In the search bar at the top-right, type `agy.exe` and press Enter.
4.  Once you find the file, right-click it and select **Copy as path**.

Please paste the path here, and I'll tell you how to add it to your system's PATH to fix the issue.

---

## User (2026-01-25 19:57:59)
I searched in my hard drive , but it seems agy.exe is nowhere. Is it possible I don't have it? How do I install it?

I also checked this folder: C:\Users\mauro\AppData\Local\Programs\Antigravity

And there is no agy.exe in the C:\Users\mauro\AppData\Local\Programs\Antigravity\bin folder or anywhere else.

---

## Gemini (2026-01-25 19:58:04)
You are right, it seems `agy.exe` is missing. This executable is part of the Gemini IDE companion, which needs to be installed directly from your code editor.

To give you the correct instructions, could you please tell me which IDE you are using (for example, VS Code, a JetBrains IDE like PyCharm, or something else)?

---

## User (2026-01-25 19:59:29)
I have installed multiple IDE, but right now I am using Antigravity and running Gemini CLI withing the Antigravity terminal. I have also cursor open, also with a terminal with Gemini CLI.

---

## Gemini (2026-01-25 19:59:39)
Thank you for the information. It seems "Antigravity" is the company that makes "Cursor", so you're using the Cursor IDE. Since Cursor is a fork of VS Code, you can install the Gemini companion from the extension marketplace within Cursor.

Here is how to install the Gemini IDE companion:

1.  Open your **Cursor** IDE.
2.  Click on the **Extensions** icon in the sidebar on the left (it looks like four squares).
3.  In the search bar at the top, type `Google Gemini`.
4.  Look for the extension named "Google Gemini" published by **Google** and click the **Install** button next to it.
5.  After the installation is complete, restart Cursor.

Once you've installed the extension and restarted the IDE, the "agy not found" error in the Gemini CLI terminal should be resolved. Please let me know if you still see the error after trying this.

---

## User (2026-01-25 20:00:42)
No, Antigravity is the IDE made by Google. Is a fork of VS Code.

---

## Gemini (2026-01-25 20:00:45)
Thank you for the clarification. My apologies for the misunderstanding. So, "Antigravity" is Google's own fork of VS Code.

In that case, the instructions I provided previously for installing the "Google Gemini" extension are still correct for your Antigravity IDE, as it functions like VS Code in terms of extension management.

Please proceed with those steps:

1.  Open your **Antigravity** IDE.
2.  Click on the **Extensions** icon in the sidebar on the left (it looks like four squares).
3.  In the search bar at the top, type `Google Gemini`.
4.  Look for the official extension named "Google Gemini" published by **Google** and click the **Install** button next to it.
5.  After the installation is complete, restart Antigravity.

This should install the necessary `agy.exe` component and resolve the "agy not found" error. Please let me know if the issue persists after these steps.

---

## User (2026-01-25 20:01:23)
I have already installed the Gemini CLI Companion from the market place.

---

## Gemini (2026-01-25 20:01:36)
Thank you for confirming. It's possible the extension is installed, but the CLI is not looking in the right place for `agy.exe`. Let's try to find where the extension installed its files.

Since "Antigravity" is a VS Code fork, it should have a similar folder structure. Could you please check the following:

1.  Open **File Explorer**.
2.  In the address bar, type `%USERPROFILE%` and press Enter. This will take you to your user folder (`C:\Users\mauro`).
3.  Look for a folder named `.vscode` or, more likely for your IDE, `.antigravity`. If you see a `.cursor` folder, check that one too.
4.  Inside that folder, there should be an `extensions` folder. Please open it.
5.  In the `extensions` folder, look for a folder that starts with `google.gemini` (e.g., `google.gemini-1.0.0`).

Can you tell me if you find that `google.gemini...` folder? If you do, please look inside it for `agy.exe` (it might be in a `bin` subfolder) and let me know the full path to it.

## User (2026-01-25 20:04:18)
This is the folder: C:\Users\mauro\.antigravity\extensions\google.gemini-cli-vscode-ide-companion-0.20.0-universal

There is no agy.exe there :

## Gemini (2026-01-25 20:04:24)
Thank you for providing the path and the directory listing. You've found the right place.

You are correct that `agy.exe` isn't in that top-level folder. In VS Code extensions, the actual executable files are often placed in a subdirectory, and `dist` is the most likely one.

I will now check the contents of the `dist` folder for you.

---

## Gemini (2026-01-25 20:05:11)
Okay, `agy.exe` is not in the `dist` folder either. Let's check the other subdirectory, `assets`, just in case.

---

## Gemini (2026-01-25 20:05:24)
It's not in the `assets` folder either. This is unexpected. The `agy.exe` file seems to be completely missing from the extension folder.

The `package.json` file in the extension's directory contains metadata about the extension. It might give us a clue as to what's going on. I will read that file.

---

## Gemini (2026-01-25 20:05:27)
I am unable to read the `package.json` file directly due to security restrictions. Could you please open that file and paste the content here?

**File path:** `C:\Users\mauro\.antigravity\extensions\google.gemini-cli-vscode-ide-companion-0.20.0-universal\package.json`

The contents of this file will help me understand how the extension is supposed to work and why `agy.exe` is missing.

## Gemini (2026-01-25 20:06:17)
Thank you for sharing the `package.json` content. This is very helpful.

The file confirms the extension is the correct one, but it doesn't contain a direct reference to `agy.exe`. However, it gives me the source code repository address. I'll investigate the source code to see how `agy.exe` is meant to be installed. This should reveal why it's missing on your system.

I will start by examining the project structure on GitHub.

---

## Gemini (2026-01-25 20:07:05)
My attempt to browse the code repository was unsuccessful. I'll try a more direct approach.

I will now fetch the `package.json` file directly from the source code repository. This file should contain the necessary details about the project's dependencies and installation scripts, which will help us understand why `agy.exe` is missing.

## Gemini (2026-01-25 20:07:11)
Thank you. I've reviewed the full `package.json`.

There are no scripts in the file that download `agy.exe`. This suggests the executable should be included in one of its dependencies. The most likely candidate is a package named `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.

I'll do a web search to learn more about this SDK and see if it's responsible for providing the `agy` executable. This should tell us why it's not being installed correctly in your environment.

---

## Gemini (2026-01-25 20:07:15)
The last search didn't give me new information. My investigation points to the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` package as the source of the missing `agy.exe` file.

I will now search for this package on the official npm (Node Package Manager) registry. The package's page there should provide the details I need to figure out why the file is not being installed.

## Gemini (2026-01-25 20:07:30)
Based on the investigation, I have a much clearer picture of what's going on.

The `agy.exe` file you're looking for is not part of the Gemini CLI companion extension. Instead, `agy` is the core component of **Google Antigravity** itself—the IDE you are using. It's the agent that enables the "agentic" features of the platform.

The Gemini CLI expects to find `agy.exe` because it's designed to integrate deeply with the Antigravity environment. The fact that `agy.exe` is missing points to an incomplete or corrupted installation of your Antigravity IDE.

The solution is to **re-install the Antigravity IDE**.

Please try re-installing it from wherever you originally downloaded it. After the installation is complete, the `agy.exe` file should be present in the installation directory, and the "agy not found" error should be resolved.
