Your task is to answer the following question about Gemini CLI:
<question>
How can I auto-approve file edits (like `replace` or `write_file`) so I don't have to manually confirm them?
</question>

## Gemini (2026-01-26 01:15:07)
To auto-approve file edits like `replace` or `write_file` in Gemini CLI, you have a few options:

1.  **Using the `--yolo` flag in Headless Mode**:
    For complete automation, especially in scripting or CI/CD environments, you can use the `--yolo` (or `-y`) flag when running Gemini CLI in headless mode. This flag will **auto-approve all actions**, including file modifications.

    Example:
    ```bash
    gemini --prompt "Replace 'old_text' with 'new_text' in file.txt" --yolo
    ```
    This is documented in `cli/headless.md`.

2.  **Using the `--approval-mode auto_edit` flag in Headless Mode**:
    When running in headless mode, you can also specify the `--approval-mode auto_edit`. This mode is designed to automatically accept file editing actions.

    Example:
    ```bash
    gemini --prompt "Write a new file named 'report.md' with content 'This is a report.'" --approval-mode auto_edit
    ```
    This is documented in `cli/headless.md`.

3.  **Configuring `tools.autoAccept` in settings**:
    You can set the `tools.autoAccept` configuration option to `true` in your `settings.json` file (located at `~/.gemini/settings.json` or `your-project/.gemini/settings.json`). However, this setting is primarily designed to "Automatically accept and execute tool calls that are considered safe (e.g., read-only operations)". While it might auto-accept some actions, it may not cover all file write operations, as file modifications are generally not considered read-only.

    To enable this, add the following to your `settings.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "tools.autoAccept": true
    }
    ```
    This setting is documented in `cli/settings.md`.

For fully bypassing manual confirmation for all file modifications, the `--yolo` flag or `--approval-mode auto_edit` in headless mode are the most comprehensive solutions.

* `cli/settings.md`

You have stopped calling tools without finishing. You have one final chance to complete the task with a short grace period. You MUST call `complete_task` immediately with your best answer and explain that your investigation was interrupted. Do not call any other tools.
