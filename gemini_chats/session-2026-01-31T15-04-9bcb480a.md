Your task is to do a deep investigation of the codebase to find all relevant files, code locations, architectural mental map and insights to solve  for the following user objective:
<objective>
Perform a fresh, independent code review of the changes described in 'pr_changes.diff'. 

Instructions:
1. Read the 'pr_changes.diff' file to understand the proposed changes.
2. Analyze the modified code files for bugs, style consistency, and alignment with project standards (refer to docs\dev_docs\contribute_to_the_project\how_to_contribute_to_the_project.md if possible).
3. Evaluate the adequacy of the tests added in tests/test_windows_platform.cpp.
4. Check the versioning and changelog updates.
5. SAVE your final review report as a markdown file at: docs/dev_docs/code_reviews/independent_pr_18_review.md.

Ensure the review is objective and does not rely on any previous analysis. provide a clear 'Summary of Recommendations' at the end of the file.
</objective>

You have exceeded the maximum number of turns. You have one final chance to complete the task with a short grace period. You MUST call `complete_task` immediately with your best answer and explain that your investigation was interrupted. Do not call any other tools.
