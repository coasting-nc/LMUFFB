Your task is to answer the following question about Gemini CLI:
<question>
Where should I place a 'GEMINI.md' file (or equivalent instruction file) in my project so that the Gemini CLI agent automatically reads it as context/instructions for the project? Is it the project root or the .gemini folder?
</question>

The Gemini CLI agent reads `GEMINI.md` files from multiple locations based on a hierarchical system to provide context to the model.

Here's how it works:

1.  **Project Root and Ancestor Context Files**: The CLI searches for a `GEMINI.md` file in your current working directory and then in each parent directory up to the project root (identified by a `.git` folder). A `GEMINI.md` file placed directly in your project root will be read as context relevant to the entire project.

2.  **Sub-directory Context Files**: The CLI also scans for `GEMINI.md` files in subdirectories below your current working directory. This means if you have a `.gemini` folder within your project (e.g., `project_root/.gemini/GEMINI.md`), and your current working directory is the `project_root` or a parent of it, the `GEMINI.md` inside the `.gemini` folder will be read as sub-directory context, allowing for highly specific instructions for that component or module.

In your specific environment context, `C:\dev\personal\LMUFFB_public\LMUFFB\.gemini\GEMINI.md` would be read as a sub-directory context file if your current working directory is `C:\dev\personal\LMUFFB_public\LMUFFB`.

In summary, both locations (the project root and a `.gemini` subfolder) can contain `GEMINI.md` files that the Gemini CLI will automatically read, each contributing to the overall context based on its position in the hierarchy.

You have stopped calling tools without finishing. You have one final chance to complete the task with a short grace period. You MUST call `complete_task` immediately with your best answer and explain that your investigation was interrupted. Do not call any other tools.
