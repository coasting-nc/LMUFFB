Your task is to do a deep investigation of the codebase to find all relevant files, code locations, architectural mental map and insights to solve  for the following user objective:
<objective>
Perform a fresh, comprehensive code review of the changes between the current HEAD and the 'main' branch, as captured in 'pr_changes.diff'. 

Focus on:
1. Identifying bugs, security risks, or performance issues.
2. Compliance with project conventions and style.
3. Effectiveness of the implementation (adding an application icon).
4. Adequacy of automated tests added for the new changes.
5. Reviewing the 'CHANGELOG.md', '.gitignore', and versioning updates.

Provide a detailed report with specific recommendations for improvements. Do not consider previous reviews; this must be an independent assessment.
</objective>

You have exceeded the maximum number of turns. You have one final chance to complete the task with a short grace period. You MUST call `complete_task` immediately with your best answer and explain that your investigation was interrupted. Do not call any other tools.
