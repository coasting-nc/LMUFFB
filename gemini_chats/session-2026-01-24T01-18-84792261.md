## Gemini (2026-01-24 01:18:56)
The Gemini CLI has a setting to automatically accept and execute tool calls without manual confirmation. This setting is `tools.autoAccept`. When set to `true`, it will automatically accept and execute tool calls that are considered safe (e.g., read-only operations). By default, this setting is `false`.

You can modify this setting in your `settings.json` file, which is located at `~/.gemini/settings.json` for user settings or `your-project/.gemini/settings.json` for workspace settings.

**Answer:** Yes, there is a setting to automatically accept tool calls that are considered safe, without manual confirmation. This setting is `tools.autoAccept`, and its default value is `false`.

**Sources:**
- `cli/settings.md`
