## User (2026-01-31 19:22:06)
Your task is to do a deep investigation of the codebase to find all relevant files, code locations, architectural mental map and insights to solve  for the following user objective:
<objective>
Perform a code review of the changes in `src/GameConnector.cpp` and `src/GameConnector.h` related to the "Auto-connect" feature and the new `Disconnect()` method. 

Analyze the code for:
1. Resource management (are handles closed properly?)
2. State consistency (is `m_connected` managed correctly?)
3. Potential race conditions or thread safety issues (given the GUI polls this).
4. Error handling.

Save your review as `PR_16_Agent_Review.md` in the project root. The file must end with a "Recap of Issues and Recommendations" section.
</objective>
