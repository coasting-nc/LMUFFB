How can I enter multi-line prompts or use line breaks in the Gemini CLI without sending the prompt immediately? Shift + Enter seems to send the prompt for the user.

To enter multi-line prompts or use line breaks in the Gemini CLI without sending the prompt immediately, you can use one of the following key combinations:

*   `Ctrl + Enter`
*   `Cmd + Enter`
*   `Paste + Enter`
*   `Shift + Enter`
*   `Ctrl + J`

According to the documentation, these combinations are specifically designed to "Insert a newline without submitting" the current prompt.

Although you mentioned that `Shift + Enter` seems to send the prompt for you, the documentation indicates it should insert a newline. If you continue to experience `Shift + Enter` sending the prompt, an alternative method to insert a newline without leaving single-line mode is to type a backslash (`\`) at the end of a line, then press `Enter`.

You have stopped calling tools without finishing. You have one final chance to complete the task with a short grace period. You MUST call `complete_task` immediately with your best answer and explain that your investigation was interrupted. Do not call any other tools.
