The Gemini CLI provides a feature to save your current chat session to a Markdown file, similar to the functionality described.

You can use the `/chat share` command to write the current conversation to a specified Markdown or JSON file.

*   **Command**: `/chat share`
*   **Usage**:
    *   To save as Markdown: `/chat share file.md`
    *   To save as JSON: `/chat share file.json`
*   If no filename is provided, the CLI will generate one.

It's important to note that while this command allows you to save the chat session to a Markdown file, it is a manual command rather than an automatic background save to a user-defined Markdown file for every session. The CLI does automatically save conversation history internally for session management, but exporting to an external Markdown file requires the explicit use of `/chat share`.

*   cli/commands.md
*   cli/session-management.md

You have stopped calling tools without finishing. You have one final chance to complete the task with a short grace period. You MUST call `complete_task` immediately with your best answer and explain that your investigation was interrupted. Do not call any other tools.
