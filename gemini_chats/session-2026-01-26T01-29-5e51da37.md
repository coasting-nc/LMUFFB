Your task is to answer the following question about Gemini CLI:
<question>
Is there a way to configure the CLI to auto-approve specific tools (like `write_file` or `replace`) while requiring approval for others? For example, via a whitelist in `settings.json`?
</question>

The Gemini CLI has a `tools.autoAccept` setting that allows for the automatic acceptance and execution of tool calls considered safe (e.g., read-only operations). This setting can be configured in your `settings.json` file (either user-specific at `~/.gemini/settings.json` or workspace-specific at `your-project/.gemini/settings.json`).

However, the documentation does not describe a mechanism to configure the CLI to auto-approve *specific* tools (like `write_file` or `replace`) via a whitelist while requiring approval for others. The `tools.autoAccept` setting appears to be a global flag for "safe" tool operations and does not offer fine-grained control over individual tools.

Additionally, the "Trusted Folders" feature impacts tool approval: if a folder is untrusted, tool auto-acceptance is disabled, and you will always be prompted before any tool is run, even if `tools.autoAccept` is enabled globally.

In summary, while there is a global auto-acceptance setting for "safe" tools, there is no documented way to create a whitelist in `settings.json` for specific tools like `write_file` or `replace` to be auto-approved while others require approval.

You have stopped calling tools without finishing. You have one final chance to complete the task with a short grace period. You MUST call `complete_task` immediately with your best answer and explain that your investigation was interrupted. Do not call any other tools.
