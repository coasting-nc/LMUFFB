Your task is to answer the following question about Gemini CLI:

Is there a command to save the current chat session state or export it as JSON so it can be resumed later in a new session?
</question>

Based on the Gemini CLI documentation, there is no direct command to explicitly save the current chat session state or export it as JSON for later resumption in a new session.

Gemini CLI handles session management automatically:
*   **Automatic Saving:** Every interaction with Gemini CLI is automatically saved in the background. This includes your prompts, the model's responses, tool executions, token usage, and assistant thoughts.
*   **Storage Location:** Sessions are stored project-specifically in `~/.gemini/tmp/<project_hash>/chats/`.
*   **Resuming Sessions:** You can resume a previous session using the `--resume` flag from the command line (e.g., `gemini --resume`) or the `/resume` slash command within the interactive interface.

While sessions are automatically saved and can be resumed, the documentation does not describe a mechanism for users to manually "save" or "export" these sessions, especially in a specific format like JSON, for external use or to be loaded into arbitrary new sessions. The system is designed for internal management and resumption of its own automatically saved states.

You have stopped calling tools without finishing. You have one final chance to complete the task with a short grace period. You MUST call `complete_task` immediately with your best answer and explain that your investigation was interrupted. Do not call any other tools.
