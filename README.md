## 📥 Download

**[Download the latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/coasting-nc/LMUFFB/releases)**


## Installation & Configuration (LMU 1.2+)



### Step-by-Step Setup

**B. Configure lmuFFB**
1.  Run `LMUFFB.exe`.
2.  **FFB Device**: In the dropdown, select your **Physical Wheel** (e.g., "Simucube 2 Pro", "Fanatec DD1").
3.  **Master Gain**: Start low (0.5) and increase.

**A. Configure Le Mans Ultimate (LMU)**
1.  Start LMU.
2.  Go to **Settings > Graphics**:
    *   Set **Display Mode** to **Borderless**. (Prevents crashes/minimizing).
3.  Go to **Controls > Force Feedback**.
4.  **Steering Axis**: Bind to your **Physical Wheel** (e.g., Simucube, Fanatec, Moza, Logitech).
5.  **In-Game Force Feedback settings in LMU**:
    *   **Disable FFB** Set FFB Effects **Off**.
    *   **FFB Strength**: reduce to **0%**.

4.  **Drive!** You should feel force feedback generated by the app.

## 🧪 Experimental Version - Testing Needed!

This is an **experimental release**, the FFB formulas may require refinement based on real-world testing.

**Please help us improve lmuFFB:**
1. **Test with caution** - Start with low wheel strength settings
2. **Experiment with settings** - Try different effect combinations and gains
3. **Share your results** - Post screenshots (including the lmuFFB console and the "Graphs" window) to the [LMU Forum Thread for the lmuFFB App](https://community.lemansultimate.com/index.php?threads/lmuffb-app.10440/)
4. **Report issues** - Let us know what works and what doesn't!

Your testing and feedback is greatly appreciated! 🙏


### Troubleshooting

-   **Inverted FFB (Force pushes away from center)**:
    -   If the FFB feels "backwards" or "inverted" while driving (wheel pushes away from center instead of pulling toward it), check the **"Invert FFB"** checkbox in the lmuFFB GUI.
    -   This reverses the force direction to match your wheel's expected behavior.
-   **No FFB**: 
    - Ensure the "FFB Device" in lmuFFB is your real wheel
    - Check if Connected to Le Mans Ultimate" appear in the GUI
    - Verify the FFB strength in your device driver is not too low
    - Increase Master Gain or reduce Max Torque Ref
    - Check the lmuFFB console for errors


### Upcoming Features

* Basic mode with only main sliders and auto adjustment of other settings
* Adaptive Optimal Slip Angle
* Wet Weather Haptics (Hydro-Grain): vibration cues telling when the tires are on dry or wet surface, and if there is grip or not 
* Per wheel Hydro-Grain to give information about a drying racing line (e.g., left tires on dry, right tires on wet)  
* Longitudinal Dynamic Weight Transfer:  feeling of the car getting heavy under braking and light under acceleration.

## Features

*   **Custom Effects**:
    *   **Grip Modulation**: Feel the wheel lighten as front tires lose grip.
    *   **Dynamic Oversteer**: Counter-steering force suggestion based on rear axle alignment torque (v0.2.2).
    *   **Progressive Lockup**: Feel the edge of tire braking limit before full lock (v0.2.2).
    *   **Traction Loss**: Feel the rear "float" and spin up under power (v0.2.2).


## Building (for developers)

## Building (for developers)

### Prerequisites (First Setup)

1.  **Compiler**: MSVC (Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools) or generic C++ compiler.
2.  **Build System**: CMake (3.10+).

**One-time Setup Steps (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# Enable execution of scripts
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Initialize build files
& 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\Tools\Launch-VsDevShell.ps1' -Arch amd64 -SkipAutomaticLocation; cmake -B build

# Download and Install ImGui (Required for GUI)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "vendor\imgui" -Force
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/archive/refs/heads/master.zip" -OutFile "vendor\imgui-master.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "vendor\imgui-master.zip" -DestinationPath "vendor" -Force
Copy-Item -Path "vendor\imgui-master\*" -Destination "vendor\imgui\" -Recurse -Force
Test-Path "vendor\imgui\imgui.cpp"
Remove-Item -Path "vendor\imgui-master.zip", "vendor\imgui-master" -Recurse -Force
```

### Build & Test

**Option 1: Build EVERYTHING (App + Tests) in one command:**
This will compile the main application, compile all test suites, and report build status.
```powershell
& 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\Tools\Launch-VsDevShell.ps1' -Arch amd64 -SkipAutomaticLocation; cmake -S . -B build; cmake --build build --config Release --clean-first
```

**Option 2: Run All Tests:**
After building, run the unified test runner to verify everything (Physics, Windows Platform, Screenshots):
```powershell
.\build\tests\Release\run_combined_tests.exe
```



### rFactor 2 Compatibility

**Note**: rFactor 2 is **not supported** in v0.4.0+. For rFactor 2, please use earlier versions of lmuFFB (v0.3.x). See the [releases page](https://github.com/coasting-nc/LMUFFB/releases) for v0.3.x downloads.
rF2 will be supported again in a future version, in particular to compare our grip approximation alghorithm with the real values returned by the game for non DLC cars.
