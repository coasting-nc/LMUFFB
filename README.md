## 📥 Download

**[Download the latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/coasting-nc/LMUFFB/releases)**


## Installation & Configuration (LMU 1.2+)



### Step-by-Step Setup

**B. Configure lmuFFB**
1.  Run `LMUFFB.exe`.
2.  **FFB Device**: In the dropdown, select your **Physical Wheel** (e.g., "Simucube 2 Pro", "Fanatec DD1").
3.  **Master Gain**: Start low (0.5) and increase.

**A. Configure Le Mans Ultimate (LMU)**
1.  Start LMU.
2.  Go to **Settings > Graphics**:
    *   Set **Display Mode** to **Borderless**. (Prevents crashes/minimizing).
3.  Go to **Controls > Force Feedback**.
4.  **Steering Axis**: Bind to your **Physical Wheel** (e.g., Simucube, Fanatec, Moza, Logitech).
5.  **In-Game Force Feedback settings in LMU**:
    *   **Disable FFB** Set FFB Effects **Off**.
    *   **FFB Strength**: reduce to **0%**.

4.  **Drive!** You should feel force feedback generated by the app.

## 🧪 Experimental Version - Testing Needed!

This is an **experimental release**, the FFB formulas may require refinement based on real-world testing.

**Please help us improve lmuFFB:**
1. **Test with caution** - Start with low wheel strength settings
2. **Experiment with settings** - Try different effect combinations and gains
3. **Share your results** - Post screenshots (including the lmuFFB console and the "Graphs" window) to the [LMU Forum Thread](https://community.lemansultimate.com/index.php?threads/irffb-for-lmu-lmuffb.10440/)
4. **Report issues** - Let us know what works and what doesn't!

Your testing and feedback is greatly appreciated! 🙏


### Troubleshooting

-   **Inverted FFB (Force pushes away from center)**:
    -   If the FFB feels "backwards" or "inverted" while driving (wheel pushes away from center instead of pulling toward it), check the **"Invert FFB"** checkbox in the lmuFFB GUI.
    -   This reverses the force direction to match your wheel's expected behavior.
-   **No FFB**: 
    - Ensure the "FFB Device" in lmuFFB is your real wheel
    - Check if Connected to Le Mans Ultimate" appear in the GUI
    - Verify the FFB strength in your device driver is not too low
    - Increase Master Gain or reduce Max Torque Ref
    - Check the lmuFFB console for errors


### Upcoming Features

* Basic mode with only main sliders and auto adjustment of other settings
* Adaptive Optimal Slip Angle
* Wet Weather Haptics (Hydro-Grain): vibration cues telling when the tires are on dry or wet surface, and if there is grip or not 
* Per wheel Hydro-Grain to give information about a drying racing line (e.g., left tires on dry, right tires on wet)  
* Longitudinal Dynamic Weight Transfer:  feeling of the car getting heavy under braking and light under acceleration.

## Features

*   **Custom Effects**:
    *   **Grip Modulation**: Feel the wheel lighten as front tires lose grip.
    *   **Dynamic Oversteer**: Counter-steering force suggestion based on rear axle alignment torque (v0.2.2).
    *   **Progressive Lockup**: Feel the edge of tire braking limit before full lock (v0.2.2).
    *   **Traction Loss**: Feel the rear "float" and spin up under power (v0.2.2).


## Building (for developers)

### Prerequisites
*   **Compiler**: MSVC (Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools) or generic C++ compiler.
*   **Build System**: CMake (3.10+).
*   **Dear ImGui (Optional)**: Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and place in `vendor/imgui` to enable the GUI.

### Option A: Command Line (Windows)
1.  Open the Powershell.
2.  Navigate to the repository root.
3.  Run the following commands:
    ```cmd
    'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\Tools\Launch-VsDevShell.ps1' -Arch amd64 -SkipAutomaticLocation; cmake --build build --config Release --clean-first
    ```

### Option C: Visual Studio 2022 (IDE)
1.  Open Visual Studio.
2.  Select "Open a local folder" and choose the repo root.
3.  Visual Studio will auto-detect `CMakeLists.txt`.
4.  Select **Build > Build All**.

### Option B: Visual Studio Code
1.  Install **VS Code**.
2.  Install extensions: **C/C++** (Microsoft) and **CMake Tools** (Microsoft).
3.  Open the repo folder in VS Code.
4.  When prompted to configure CMake, select your installed compiler kit (e.g., *Visual Studio Community 2022 Release - x86_amd64*).
5.  Click **Build** in the bottom status bar.


### rFactor 2 Compatibility

**Note**: rFactor 2 is **not supported** in v0.4.0+. For rFactor 2, please use earlier versions of lmuFFB (v0.3.x). See the [releases page](https://github.com/coasting-nc/LMUFFB/releases) for v0.3.x downloads.
rF2 will be supported again in a future version, in particular to compare our grip approximation alghorithm with the real values returned by the game for non DLC cars.
