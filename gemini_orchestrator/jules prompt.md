<issue title and text>

Create a new branch to work on this task.

In performing this task you have to do the following things:
* Create an implementation plan, following these instructions: gemini_orchestrator\templates\A.1_architect_prompt.md

* Do a review of the implementation plan, and updated it accordingly, following these instructions: gemini_orchestrator\templates\A.2_plan_reviewer_prompt.md

* Implement the plan, following these instructions: gemini_orchestrator\templates\B_developer_prompt.md. Remember that you should verify that ALL tests pass before proceeding, including previous tests (not just the new ones). Remember that you have to follow a TDD development process: first write the new tests (and possibly some stubs of the main code to make it compile), verify that they fail, then implement the code to make them pass, and finally verify that all tests pass.

* Do a code review of the implementation, following these instructions: gemini_orchestrator\templates\C_auditor_prompt_(code_review).md
