Perform the following task:

**Task: Implement Rear Wheel Lockup Support & Frequency Differentiation**

**Reference Documents:**
*   `docs\dev_docs\lockup vibration fix.md` (Contains the detailed analysis and code snippets)
*   `FFBEngine.h`
*   `tests/test_ffb_engine.cpp`

**Context:**
Users reported that the "Lockup Vibration" effect is silent when locking up the rear brakes (common in LMP2 cars). Investigation revealed the current logic only monitors the front wheels.
We need to update the physics engine to monitor all four wheels and provide a distinct tactile cue (Lower Frequency) for rear lockups to help drivers differentiate between understeer (front lock) and instability (rear lock).

**Implementation Requirements:**

1.  **Update `FFBEngine.h` (calculate_force)**:
    *   Locate the "Progressive Lockup" section (approx line 780).
    *   Update the logic to calculate slip ratios for **all four wheels** (FL, FR, RL, RR).
    *   Determine the worst slip for the Front Axle and the Rear Axle independently.
    *   Implement the differentiation logic:
        *   If **Rear Slip** is worse than Front Slip: Use Rear Slip as the trigger, and set a `freq_multiplier` of **0.5** (Low Pitch / Judder).
        *   Otherwise: Use Front Slip, and set `freq_multiplier` of **1.0** (High Pitch / Screech).
    *   Apply the `freq_multiplier` to the base frequency calculation (`base_freq * freq_multiplier`).
    *   *Optional:* Apply a slight amplitude boost (e.g., 1.2x) if it is a rear lockup to emphasize the danger.

2.  **Update `tests/test_ffb_engine.cpp`**:
    *   Add a new test function: `static void test_rear_lockup_differentiation()`.
    *   **Pass 1:** Simulate Front Lockup. Verify `m_lockup_phase` advances. Store the delta.
    *   **Pass 2:** Simulate Rear Lockup. Verify `m_lockup_phase` advances (fixing the bug). Store the delta.
    *   **Pass 3:** Compare deltas. Verify that `RearDelta / FrontDelta` is approximately **0.5** (verifying the frequency drop).
    *   Register the new test in `main()`.

3.  **Documentation**:
    *   Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a new entry (e.g., "Fixed Lockup effect ignoring rear wheels" and "Added Low-Frequency Judder for rear lockups").
    *   Increment `VERSION` (e.g., to v0.5.11).

**Deliverables:**
1.  Modified `FFBEngine.h`
2.  Modified `tests/test_ffb_engine.cpp`
3.  Updated `CHANGELOG.md`
4.  Updated `VERSION`
