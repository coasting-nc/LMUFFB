**Task: Implement Device Selection Persistence and Connection Hardening**

**Reference Documents:**
*   `docs/dev_docs/archived/Archived - Fix wheel device disconnecting.md` (Contains the detailed technical report and code snippets).

**Context:**
Users (specifically GamerMuscle) have reported two critical usability issues:
1.  **Connection Loss:** The FFB stops working if the app loses focus or if the game momentarily steals the device priority. The current re-acquisition logic is insufficient because it doesn't explicitly restart the FFB motor.
2.  **No Persistence:** The user has to manually re-select their steering wheel every time the app starts.
3.  **Console Spam:** The "FFB Output Saturated" warning makes it hard to see connection errors.

**Implementation Requirements:**

1.  **`src/DirectInputFFB.h` & `src/DirectInputFFB.cpp`**:
    *   Add static helper methods `GuidToString` and `StringToGuid` to convert `GUID` structs to strings.
    *   Implement `GetActiveWindowTitle()` using `GetForegroundWindow` and `GetWindowTextA` (requires `<psapi.h>` or just `<windows.h>`).
    *   **Refactor `UpdateForce`**:
        *   Remove/Comment out the "FFB Output Saturated" warning block to declutter the console.
        *   Implement robust error handling for `SetParameters`.
        *   Catch `DIERR_INPUTLOST`, `DIERR_NOTACQUIRED`, and `DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO`.
        *   Log the error type and the **Active Window Title** (rate-limited to 1s) to diagnose if the game is stealing focus.
        *   Attempt immediate recovery: `Acquire()` followed by **`m_pEffect->Start(1, 0)`** (Critical fix for silent wheel).

2.  **`src/Config.h` & `src/Config.cpp`**:
    *   Add static member `std::string m_last_device_guid`.
    *   Update `Save` and `Load` methods to persist this value to `config.ini` under the key `last_device_guid`.

3.  **`src/GuiLayer.cpp`**:
    *   Modify `DrawTuningWindow`:
        *   Inside the device enumeration block (where `devices` are populated), check if `Config::m_last_device_guid` is set.
        *   If set, iterate through the device list, compare GUIDs, and auto-select the matching device.
        *   When the user manually selects a device from the combo box, update `Config::m_last_device_guid` and call `Config::Save(engine)` immediately.

**Deliverables:**
*   Modified `src/DirectInputFFB.h` and `src/DirectInputFFB.cpp`
*   Modified `src/Config.h` and `src/Config.cpp`
*   Modified `src/GuiLayer.cpp`
*   Updated `CHANGELOG.md` (Add entry for "Device Persistence" and "Connection Hardening")
*   Updated `VERSION` (Increment patch version)

**Check-list for completion:**
- [ ] `DirectInputFFB`: GUID helpers implemented.
- [ ] `DirectInputFFB`: `UpdateForce` restarts effect (`Start(1,0)`) on recovery.
- [ ] `DirectInputFFB`: Diagnostics log the Active Window Title on error.
- [ ] `Config`: `last_device_guid` is saved and loaded.
- [ ] `GuiLayer`: App auto-selects the previously used wheel on startup.
- [ ] `GuiLayer`: Selecting a wheel saves the config immediately.
