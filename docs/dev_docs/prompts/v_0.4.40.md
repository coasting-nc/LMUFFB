Once you have reviewed these documents, please proceed with the following task:

**Task: Implement Latency Fixes & GUI Improvements for Smoothing Filters**

**Reference Documents:**
*   `docs/dev_docs/Fix Latency of SoP Smoothing and Slip Angle smoothing (Analysis & Implementation Plan).md` (Contains the detailed analysis, math, and implementation plan)
*   `FFBEngine.h`
*   `src/GuiLayer.cpp`

**Context:**
Users have reported a perceived delay in the Force Feedback signal compared to the base game. Investigation revealed that the default smoothing settings were too aggressive, introducing ~95ms of latency.
We need to:
1.  Update default values to target ~15ms latency (acceptable for both Direct Drive and Belt wheels).
2.  Expose the internal "Slip Angle Smoothing" time constant as a user-configurable setting.
3.  Update the GUI to explicitly display the calculated latency (in milliseconds) for these filters, using color-coding to warn users of high latency.

**Implementation Requirements:**

1.  **Physics Engine (`FFBEngine.h`)**:
    *   Promote the hardcoded `const double tau = 0.0225;` inside `calculate_slip_angle` to a public member variable `float m_slip_angle_smoothing`.
    *   Set the default value of `m_slip_angle_smoothing` to **0.015f** (15ms).
    *   Update `calculate_slip_angle` to use this member variable (cast to double) and apply a safety clamp (`if (tau < 0.0001) tau = 0.0001;`).

2.  **Configuration (`src/Config.h` & `src/Config.cpp`)**:
    *   **Defaults**: Change the default `sop_smoothing` in `Config.h` from `0.05f` to **`0.85f`** (Note: SoP formula is `(1.0 - factor) * 100ms`, so 0.85 = 15ms).
    *   **New Setting**: Add `float slip_smoothing` to the `Preset` struct (default `0.015f`).
    *   **Methods**: Update `Preset::Apply`, `Preset::UpdateFromEngine`, and add a fluent setter `SetSlipSmoothing`.
    *   **Persistence**: Update `Config::Save` and `Config::Load` to handle the new `slip_angle_smoothing` key.
    *   **Presets**: Update `Config::LoadPresets` so the "Default (T300)" and "T300" presets explicitly use the new 15ms values (`.SetSmoothing(0.85f)` and `.SetSlipSmoothing(0.015f)`).

3.  **GUI Layer (`src/GuiLayer.cpp`)**:
    *   **Refactor "SoP Smoothing" Slider**:
        *   Calculate latency: `int lat_ms = (int)((1.0f - engine.m_sop_smoothing_factor) * 100.0f);`
        *   Add a text label *above* the slider.
        *   If `lat_ms > 20`: Display `(SIGNAL LATENCY: XX ms)` in **Red**.
        *   If `lat_ms <= 20`: Display `(Latency: XX ms - OK)` in **Green**.
        *   Update the slider format string dynamically to show `val (XXms lag)`.
        *   Update the tooltip to explain the trade-off (High Latency = Smooth but Slow; Low Latency = Fast but Grainy).
    *   **Add "Slip Angle Smoothing" Slider**:
        *   Place it in the "Advanced Tuning" section.
        *   Calculate latency: `int slip_ms = (int)(engine.m_slip_angle_smoothing * 1000.0f);`
        *   Implement the same Red/Green text label logic (Threshold: 20ms).
        *   Slider Range: `0.000` to `0.100` seconds.
        *   Add a tooltip explaining it affects "Physics Response Time" for Understeer and Rear Align Torque.

**Deliverables:**
*   Modified `FFBEngine.h`
*   Modified `src/Config.h` and `src/Config.cpp`
*   Modified `src/GuiLayer.cpp`
*   Updated `CHANGELOG.md` (New entry under a new version number)
*   Updated `VERSION` file

**Check-list for completion:**
- [ ] `FFBEngine.h`: `m_slip_angle_smoothing` added and used.
- [ ] `Config.h`: Defaults updated (SoP=0.85, Slip=0.015).
- [ ] `Config.cpp`: Save/Load/Presets updated.
- [ ] `GuiLayer.cpp`: SoP slider shows Red/Green latency text.
- [ ] `GuiLayer.cpp`: Slip Angle slider added with Red/Green latency text.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated.
- [ ] `VERSION` incremented.
- [ ] Code compiles successfully.

### Git / Large Diff Issue
*   **Issue:** `git status`, `git fetch`, or other commands may fail with "The diff size is unusually large" if the repository state is significantly different or if build artifacts are not ignored.
*   **Workaround:** Rely on `read_file`, `overwrite_file`, and `replace_with_git_merge_diff` directly. Do not depend on bash commands for verification if this error occurs. Ensure `.gitignore` covers all build directories (e.g., `tests/build/`).


#### Git & Repo Management

##### Submodule Trap
*   **Issue:** Cloning a repo inside an already initialized repo (even if empty) can lead to nested submodules or detached git states.
*   **Fix:** Ensure the root directory is correctly initialized or cloned into. If working in a provided sandbox with `.git`, configure the remote and fetch rather than cloning into a subdirectory.

##### File Operations
*   **Lesson:** When moving files from a nested repo to root, ensure hidden files (like `.git`) are handled correctly or that the root `.git` is properly synced.
*   **Tooling:** `replace_with_git_merge_diff` requires exact context matching. If files are modified or desynchronized, `overwrite_file_with_block` is safer.
