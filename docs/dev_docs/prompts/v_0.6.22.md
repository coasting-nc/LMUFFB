**Task: Implement Automatic Idle Smoothing to Fix Engine Vibration**

**Reference Documents:**
*   `docs\dev_docs\Automatic Idle Smoothing.md` (Contains the detailed analysis and code snippets)
*   `src/FFBEngine.h`
*   `tests/test_ffb_engine.cpp`

**Context:**
Users report that the steering wheel "bounces around on the tune of the engine rpm" when the car is stationary. This is caused by the game's physics engine transmitting engine vibration through the steering column (`mSteeringShaftTorque`).
We cannot simply mute the force at standstill (like we did for textures) because the user needs to feel the "Static Weight" (tire friction) to turn the wheel.
**Solution:** We will apply **Automatic Idle Smoothing**. When the car is moving slowly (< 3.0 m/s), we dynamically increase the Low Pass Filter (LPF) on the steering shaft signal to filter out high-frequency engine noise (AC) while preserving the steady steering weight (DC).

**Implementation Requirements:**

1.  **Modify `src/FFBEngine.h`**:
    *   Locate the `calculate_force` method where `game_force` is processed (around line 600).
    *   Implement the **Idle Smoothing Logic**:
        *   Define constants: `IDLE_SPEED_THRESHOLD = 3.0` (m/s) and `IDLE_SMOOTHING_TARGET = 0.1` (seconds).
        *   Calculate `car_speed_abs`.
        *   If speed < threshold, calculate a blend factor (1.0 at 0 speed, 0.0 at threshold).
        *   Calculate `dynamic_smooth = IDLE_SMOOTHING_TARGET * blend`.
        *   Set `effective_shaft_smoothing = std::max(user_setting, dynamic_smooth)`.
    *   Ensure this `effective_shaft_smoothing` is used in the LPF calculation for `m_steering_shaft_torque_smoothed`.

2.  **Modify `tests/test_ffb_engine.cpp`**:
    *   Add a new test case `test_idle_smoothing()`.
    *   **Scenario 1 (Idle):** Speed = 0. Input = 20Hz Sine Wave (Engine Vibration). Verify output amplitude is significantly attenuated (< 1.5 Nm vs 5.0 Input).
    *   **Scenario 2 (Driving):** Speed = 20. Input = 20Hz Sine Wave (Road Noise). Verify output amplitude is passed through (near 5.0 Nm).

3.  **Documentation**:
    *   Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a new version entry (e.g., v0.6.22).
    *   Increment the version number in the `VERSION` file.

**Deliverables:**
*   Modified `src/FFBEngine.h`
*   Modified `tests/test_ffb_engine.cpp`
*   Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION`

**Check-list for completion:**
- [ ] `FFBEngine.h`: Idle smoothing logic implemented correctly.
- [ ] `test_ffb_engine.cpp`: `test_idle_smoothing` added and passing.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION` updated.
- [ ] Code compiles and tests pass.
