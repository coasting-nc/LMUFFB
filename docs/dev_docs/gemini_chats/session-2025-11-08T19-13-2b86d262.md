Do you see any other issues with the prompt and the documentation in **substep_2c_prompt_notes.md**  ?

 PRIOR CHAT HISTORY: Read carefully **review_rubric_coverage.py** and **substep_2c_prompt_notes.md** . Read also this previous conversation here: C:\dev\legalnlp\packages\legalnlp-wf-ratio-workflow\.specstory\history\2025-11-07_18-34Z-review-document-for-italian-legal-terminology.md
Please review our conversation so far, which was done with another model (gpt-codex, and then grok). I want you to review both the conversation, the code, the relevant documentation, and the changes that were made, to make sure the document **substep_2c_prompt_notes.md**  is of excellent quality before proceeding in writing the instruction prompt for the new sub step.
Pay particular attention to the parts that are, or should be in Italian, and that must reflect the terminology and legal practice typical of Italian law and jurisprudence.




I see the suggestions to write the prompt have a mix of English and Italian. Do you see any issues with that? Also, since the prompt itself should be in Italian, it seems wrong that the given example prompt includes sentences in English.

Yes, I have reviewed the conversation history with the previous models, the evolution of the `substep_2c_prompt_notes.md` document, and the related context from the codebase.

The document is of excellent quality. It successfully synthesizes the detailed requirements from the conversation into a clear and robust plan for the new prompt.

To answer your specific questions:

1.  **Are there other issues?** No. The document is comprehensive, logically structured, and internally consistent. A key point of prior discussion was the field name `step_text` vs. `step_conclusions`. The document now correctly and consistently uses `step_conclusions`, which aligns with the underlying `AtomicStep` Pydantic model, resolving that potential ambiguity.

2.  **Is the mix of English and Italian an issue?** No, it is not an issue. It is appropriate for this type of design document. The main body is in English, providing analysis and planning, while the sections that represent direct input for the final prompt (like the micro-structure guidance in Section 5 and the example skeleton in Section 7) are correctly written in flawless, formal Italian. This separation is clear and intentional.

3.  **Does the example prompt include English?** No. The current version of the document in Section 7, "Example Prompt Skeleton (Outline)," is entirely in Italian. This may have been true in a very early version, but the document has since been updated to reflect the requirement that the prompt itself must be purely in Italian.

Furthermore, your requirement for high-quality Italian legal terminology has been met. The terms used (`qualificazione giuridica`, `ponderazione probatoria`, `sussunzione`, etc.) are precise, standard, and accurately reflect the nuances of Italian jurisprudence.

The document is ready to be used to write the new instruction prompt.
