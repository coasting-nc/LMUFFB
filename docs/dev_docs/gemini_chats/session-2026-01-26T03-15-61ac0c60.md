Your task is to answer the following question about Gemini CLI:
<question>
Where do the loading screen jokes (e.g., 'Converting coffee into code...') come from in the Gemini CLI? Are they hardcoded, generated, or sourced from somewhere specific? Who wrote them?
</question>

The loading screen jokes, referred to as "witty phrases" or "loading phrases" in the Gemini CLI documentation, come from a predefined list within the application.

Here's a breakdown:
1.  **Origin**: They are internal "loading phrases" or "witty phrases" that the CLI cycles through during loading screens.
2.  **Hardcoded, Generated, or Sourced**:
    *   The CLI comes with a set of **default** loading phrases, which are implied to be hardcoded within the application's source code.
    *   Users can provide their **own custom phrases** via the `ui.customWittyPhrases` setting in their `settings.json` file. When `customWittyPhrases` are provided, the CLI cycles through these user-defined phrases instead of the defaults. This confirms that the jokes are sourced from a static list (either internal defaults or user-provided).
    *   They are **not dynamically generated** by an LLM for each loading instance.
3.  **Who wrote them**: The default loading phrases are written by the developers and contributors of the Gemini CLI. For any custom witty phrases specified by the user, the user themselves is the author.

You can also disable these loading phrases for accessibility purposes by setting `ui.accessibility.disableLoadingPhrases` to `true` in your `settings.json`.

**Sources:**
- `get-started/configuration.md`
- `cli/settings.md`

You have stopped calling tools without finishing. You have one final chance to complete the task with a short grace period. You MUST call `complete_task` immediately with your best answer and explain that your investigation was interrupted. Do not call any other tools.

<question>
Where are the loading screen messages (e.g., 'Converting coffee into code...') defined in the Gemini CLI source code or documentation? I am trying to understand their origin.
</question>

## Gemini (2026-01-26 03:15:55)
The Gemini CLI documentation confirms the existence of "loading phrases" which are displayed during loading sequences. This is indicated by the `ui.accessibility.disableLoadingPhrases` setting, which allows users to disable these phrases for accessibility purposes.

However, the documentation does not explicitly list the specific loading phrases (such as "Converting coffee into code...") or specify the exact location within the source code where these messages are defined. These phrases are likely hardcoded within the CLI's UI or accessibility-related source modules rather than being in a user-editable configuration file or a dedicated documentation page listing them.

Therefore, while the documentation confirms the presence and customizability (disabling) of these loading messages, it does not provide their specific content or exact origin within the source code.

**Sources:**
* `cli/settings.md`
