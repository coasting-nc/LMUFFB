Your task is to answer the following question about Gemini CLI:
<question>
How do I configure the default export format for '/chat share' to be Markdown (.md) instead of JSON? The user wants to run '/chat share' without arguments and have it default to .md.
</question>

## Gemini (2026-01-26 01:45:33)
While the Gemini CLI provides the `/chat share` command to export conversations as Markdown (`.md`) or JSON (`.json`) files by explicitly specifying the file extension (e.g., `/chat share my_conversation.md`), the available documentation does not describe a setting to configure the *default* export format when `/chat share` is run without any arguments or a specified file extension.

The `cli/commands.md` file states:
> **`/chat share`**
> **Description:** Writes the current conversation to a provided Markdown or JSON file.
> **Usage:** `/chat share file.md` or `/chat share file.json`. If no filename is provided, then the CLI will generate one.

This implies that the CLI has an internal default when no filename is provided. However, the `cli/settings.md` file, which lists all configurable settings, does not contain any entry for a `chat.share.defaultExportFormat` or similar setting that would control this specific behavior. The `output.format` setting under the `Output` category is for general CLI output (`text` or `json`) and does not apply to the `/chat share` command's export format.

Therefore, based on the current documentation, there is no direct configuration option to change the default export format for `/chat share` to `.md` when executed without arguments. To ensure the output is in Markdown, the user must explicitly provide a filename with the `.md` extension, such as `/chat share conversation.md`.

You have stopped calling tools without finishing. You have one final chance to complete the task with a short grace period. You MUST call `complete_task` immediately with your best answer and explain that your investigation was interrupted. Do not call any other tools.

Your task is to answer the following question about Gemini CLI:
<question>
Does Gemini CLI support creating aliases for slash commands? specifically, can I create an alias that runs "/chat share auto_generated_name.md"?
</question>

## Gemini (2026-01-26 01:46:00)
The Gemini CLI does not directly support creating aliases for existing internal slash commands in the way you described (e.g., having `/myalias` internally execute `/chat share auto_generated_name.md`).

Custom commands, as described in the documentation, allow you to create shortcuts for prompts that are sent to the Gemini model. When you define a custom command, its `prompt` field contains the text that will be sent to the model, potentially with arguments, shell command outputs (`!{...}`), or file contents (`@{...}`) injected. However, the `prompt` is interpreted as input to the model, not as an instruction to execute another internal Gemini CLI slash command.

For example, if you were to define a custom command like this:
```toml
# In: ~/.gemini/commands/myshare.toml
prompt = "/chat share auto_generated_name.md"
```
When you run `/myshare`, the literal string `/chat share auto_generated_name.md` would be sent to the Gemini model as part of your prompt, rather than the CLI executing `/chat share auto_generated_name.md` as a command.

The `!{...}` syntax within custom commands is used to execute *shell commands* and inject their output into the prompt, not to execute other Gemini CLI slash commands.

Therefore, you cannot create an alias that runs the built-in `/chat share` command through a custom command directly.
