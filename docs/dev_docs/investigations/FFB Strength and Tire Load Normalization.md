# **Mathematical and Logic Frameworks for Dynamic Force Feedback Normalization and Tire Load Scaling in High-Fidelity Racing Simulations**

The engineering of haptic interfaces in digital motorsport has evolved from simple vibrational cues to complex, high-bandwidth force-feedback systems that attempt to replicate the mechanical intricacies of a vehicle's steering rack and chassis dynamics. In modern simulations such as Le Mans Ultimate (LMU) and iRacing, the steering wheel serves as the primary data conduit between the physics engine and the driver. However, the vast disparity in steering torque and vertical tire loads across different vehicle classes—ranging from low-downforce GT3 cars to extreme high-downforce Hypercars—presents a significant challenge for telemetry-based applications.1 Without robust normalization frameworks, a user tuned for one class of vehicle will inevitably experience either pervasive signal clipping or a lack of communicative detail when transitioning to another.3 This report investigates the mathematical methodologies for normalizing steering torque and scaling tire-load-dependent tactile effects, proposing a unified logic framework that accounts for both vehicle-specific physics and the variable torque capabilities of consumer and professional-grade direct drive wheelbases.3

## **The Biomechanics and Physics of Steering Torque Variance**

To develop a normalization algorithm, one must first quantify the signals produced by the underlying physics simulation. The steering shaft torque transmitted to a driver is a product of several factors: pneumatic trail, mechanical trail (caster), scrub radius, and the assistance provided by power-steering systems.1 In a simulator like Le Mans Ultimate, these values are typically output as raw Newton-meter (Nm) values representing the torque at the steering rack or column.2

The variation across classes is a direct consequence of aerodynamic and mechanical design. GT3 and GTE vehicles are designed with sophisticated power-assisted steering (PAS) systems that cap the physical torque at the steering wheel, even while the rack experiences high loads. Telemetry often indicates peak values in the range of 25-30 Nm, though real-world drivers may only sustain 8-12 Nm during cornering.7 In contrast, Hypercars and Le Mans Prototypes (LMP) utilize massive aerodynamic downforce to generate vertical loads that significantly increase the self-aligning moment of the tires. Consequently, the steering shaft torque in these vehicles can peak at 45-60 Nm or higher.2 Vehicles without power steering, such as the Dallara DW12 or certain Formula 3 cars, present even more extreme cases, where simulated rack torques can exceed 100 Nm, far surpassing the physical output of almost all consumer wheelbases.10

### **Comparative Table of Simulated Peak Steering Torques**

| Vehicle Class | Peak Rack Torque (Telemetry Nm) | Typical Real-World Sustained Torque | Power Steering Implementation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| GT3 / GTE | 25 \- 35 Nm | 8 \- 12 Nm | High Assistance 7 |
| LMP2 | 35 \- 50 Nm | 11 \- 15 Nm | Moderate Assistance 2 |
| Hypercar (LMH/LMDh) | 50 \- 65 Nm | 15 \- 20 Nm | Electronic Assistance 2 |
| Formula 3 | 35 \- 45 Nm | 10 \- 20 Nm | No Assistance 1 |
| IndyCar (DW12) | 80 \- 120 Nm | 25 \- 40 Nm | No Assistance 10 |

This disparity leads to the "Technical Problem of Strength": if a global gain is set to make a GT3 car feel heavy and detailed, a Hypercar will saturate the motor, leading to "clipping," where all torque variations above the motor's limit are lost as a flat 100% signal.3 Conversely, if the system is tuned to accommodate Hypercar peaks, the GT3 car feels "limp," and the signal-to-noise ratio of the wheelbase's motor leads to a loss of subtle road textures.4

## **Frameworks for Steering Torque Normalization**

The objective of normalization is to map a variable physics-based range $$ to a consistent internal range ![][image1] or a common reference torque ![][image2]. This ensures that the user's perceived "weight" of the car remains consistent across classes while preserving the unique characteristics of each vehicle's steering feel.2

### **Class-Aware Reference Mapping**

The most stable approach for applications like LMUFFB is the implementation of a class-aware lookup table of "Reference Peak Torques." By assigning a specific normalization constant to each vehicle category (e.g., 30 Nm for GT3, 50 Nm for Hypercars), the application can scale the incoming Nm signal to a common baseline before final output scaling.2

The mathematical scaling factor ![][image3] for a specific car is defined as:

![][image4]  
Where ![][image5] is the target torque range for the internal application logic (e.g., 30 Nm), and ![][image6] is the expected peak for that class. For a GT3 car with a 30 Nm reference, ![][image7]. For a Hypercar with a 60 Nm reference, ![][image8]. This effectively attenuates the Hypercar signal so that its 60 Nm peak is treated identically to the GT3's 30 Nm peak within the application's processing pipeline.4

The primary advantage of this method is consistency. The driver knows exactly how a car will feel upon loading into a session. The disadvantage is that it does not account for car setups or track-specific demands (e.g., higher downforce setups at Monza vs. high-downforce setups at Spa).1

### **Dynamic Peak Chasing with Hysteresis**

An alternative to static mapping is a "session-learned" peak algorithm, similar to iRacing's "Auto" strength function.5 This algorithm monitors the maximum steering shaft torque encountered during several "clean" laps and sets the clipping point slightly above this observed peak.3

A robust implementation requires a peak detector with a fast-attack and extremely slow-decay characteristic to prevent the FFB from "getting heavy" on straightaways as the peak resets.15 The decay constant ![][image9] for a peak tracker ![][image10] should be tuned to maintain the session peak for several minutes:

![][image11]  
For a 1000 Hz processing loop, ![][image12] ensures a slow decay while allowing for gradual adjustments if the driver changes their driving style or car setup mid-session.15

However, dynamic peak chasing is vulnerable to "physics noise" from accidents or curb strikes. If a driver hits a wall, the instantaneous torque may spike to 200 Nm, causing the algorithm to set a normalization factor that makes normal cornering feel virtually non-existent.18 To mitigate this, a "Hysteresis Window" or "Z-Score" rejection logic is required. If a new data point ![][image13] exceeds the current ![][image10] by a significant margin (e.g., \>50%), it is flagged as a transient spike and its contribution to ![][image10] is filtered through a low-pass or median filter.17

### **Integrated iRacing "Wheel Force" vs. "Max Force" Logic**

Industry-standard implementations, specifically iRacing, utilize a three-parameter system: Wheel Force, Max Force, and Intensity.5

1. **Wheel Force**: The physical torque limit of the wheelbase (e.g., 25 Nm for Simucube 2 Pro). This acts as a safety floor, preventing the "Auto" algorithm from setting a "Max Force" lower than the wheel can actually produce, which would result in dangerously high torques on weak cars.12  
2. **Max Force**: The simulated rack torque that corresponds to 100% motor output. A higher "Max Force" results in a lighter-feeling wheel because a larger simulated torque is required to reach the motor's limit.3  
3. **Intensity**: A secondary scalar that determines how much of the available dynamic range is used. A 100% intensity setting pushes the "Max Force" as close to the "Wheel Force" as possible without constant clipping.5

This logic suggests that for a telemetry app, the optimal path is a **Class-Aware Baseline** that can be **Dynamically Adjusted** by the user through a single "Intensity" or "Strength" slider.2

## **Tire Load Normalization for Tactile and Haptic Effects**

Beyond the primary steering weight, FFB applications generate "secondary" effects such as road texture, engine vibration, and braking haptics.6 These effects are traditionally scaled by the current tire load (![][image14]) to simulate the increased friction and detail transmitted through a "loaded" tire.24

### **The Failure of "Chasing Peak" Load Normalization**

In high-downforce vehicles, vertical tire loads vary dramatically with speed. A Hypercar may have a static load of 3,500 N per corner, which increases to 12,000 N at 300 km/h due to aerodynamic downforce.2

If these effects are normalized by a "chasing peak" (the highest load seen in the session), the normalization factor ![][image15] eventually reaches 1.0 at high speed. However, at low speed, the factor becomes ![][image16]. This results in a "muted" or "limp" road texture at low speeds, which is counter-intuitive for the driver.2 The "extra detail" intended for high-speed, high-load cornering is effectively neutralized because the algorithm treats the highest possible load as the "standard" 1.0x baseline.

### **Static Load Anchoring Logic**

The mathematically superior approach is "Static Load Anchoring." This method uses the car's weight at rest (static load) as the 1.0x baseline for all tactile effect scaling.25

Let ![][image17] be the vertical load on a tire when the car is stationary on a level surface. The load-normalization factor ![][image18] is defined as:

![][image19]  
Under this framework:

* **At Low Speeds**: ![][image20]. Road textures and ABS pulses feel "nominal" and communicative.25  
* **At High Speeds (High Aero)**: ![][image18] may reach 2.5x or 3.0x. This allows tactile effects to naturally become stronger and more "violent" as aerodynamic downforce increases, effectively communicating the "compression" of the car into the track surface.2  
* **During Unloading (Weight Transfer/Crest)**: If a wheel becomes light over a crest, ![][image18] drops toward 0.0, naturally muting road textures as the tire loses contact.25

### **Comparison of Load Normalization Methods**

| Normalization Logic | Reference Point | Low Speed Detail | High Speed Detail | Perceived Realism |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Peak Chasing** | Max Session Load | Muted / Weak | Nominal (1.0x) | Low; feels "dead" at low speed. 24 |
| **Static Anchoring** | Corner Weight @ 0km/h | Nominal (1.0x) | Intense / Heavier | High; communicates aero load. 25 |
| **Global Fixed** | Hardcoded Value (e.g. 4000N) | Variable | Variable | Mid; inconsistent across cars. 2 |

The implementation of Static Load Anchoring requires the application to "learn" the static weight of the car. This can be achieved by sampling the tire loads during the first few seconds of a session while the vehicle is in the pit lane (![][image21]).27

## **Signal Conditioning: Soft-Knee Compression and Filtering**

When mapping high-dynamic-range physics to the limited output of a consumer wheelbase, "hard clipping" must be avoided. Hard clipping creates a non-linear "shelf" where all information above the threshold is lost, resulting in a "numb" feeling during high-load cornering or curb strikes.3

### **Soft-Knee Compression for Clipping Prevention**

A "Soft-Knee" compressor gradually reduces the gain as the signal approaches the threshold, rather than abruptly cutting it off.29 This preserves the "gradient" of the torque, allowing the driver to still feel a curb strike even if the car is already at 90% of the motor's torque capacity.32

The output torque ![][image22] can be modeled using a soft-knee function: For an input ![][image23], threshold ![][image24], and knee width ![][image25]: $$y \= \\begin{cases} x & \\text{if } x \< T \- \\frac{W}{2} \\ x \+ \\frac{(1/R \- 1)(x \- T \+ W/2)^2}{2W} & \\text{if } T \- \\frac{W}{2} \\le x \\le T \+ \\frac{W}{2} \\ T \+ \\frac{x \- T}{R} & \\text{if } x \> T \+ \\frac{W}{2} \\end{cases}$$ Where ![][image26] is the compression ratio. In FFB applications, ![][image26] is often set very high (e.g., 20:1) to act as a limiter.35 This "OverEasy" style compression is preferred for vocals in audio but is equally effective for "rounding off" harsh FFB spikes from wall impacts while keeping cornering forces detailed.29

### **Timestep Filtering and Jitter Reduction**

Telemetry data is inherently discrete, often delivered at 60 Hz or 100 Hz, while high-end Direct Drive motors require torque updates at 1000 Hz or higher.6 This leads to "stepping" artifacts. To ensure smooth normalization, the tire load and torque signals must be filtered to remove high-frequency "jitter" that would otherwise cause the normalization factor to fluctuate rapidly.24

NVIDIA PhysX logic recommends a sub-linear filter for tire loads to mitigate "jerky" handling caused by large timesteps.24 A simple Exponential Moving Average (EMA) or a second-order Butterworth filter is typically applied:

![][image27]  
Where ![][image28] is the smoothing time constant (e.g., 0.04s for LMUFFB).38 This ensures that the normalization factor ![][image18] changes smoothly, preventing the haptic effects from feeling "grainy" or "robotic".19

## **Technical Implementation in C++ (LMUFFB Context)**

For a C++ application like LMUFFB, the normalization framework must be integrated into the telemetry processing loop. The following logical steps represent the proposed optimal implementation.

### **Steering Strength Normalization Logic**

The application should maintain a CarDatabase containing the ReferencePeakNm for each vehicle. If a vehicle is not in the database, it defaults to a session-learning mode.2

C++

float NormalizeTorque(float rawNm, CarData car) {  
    // 1\. Get reference peak (either from DB or learned)  
    float refPeak \= car.referencePeakNm;  
      
    // 2\. Calculate the base gain to map to internal 30Nm baseline  
    float normalizationGain \= 30.0f / refPeak;  
    float normalizedSignal \= rawNm \* normalizationGain;  
      
    // 3\. Apply user Master Gain and Steering Shaft Gain  
    float finalSignal \= normalizedSignal \* userMasterGain \* car.steeringShaftGain;  
      
    // 4\. Apply Soft-Knee limiting at the 1.0 (100% duty cycle) threshold  
    return ApplySoftKnee(finalSignal, 0.9f, 0.2f); // Threshold 0.9, Width 0.2  
}

This ensures that a GT3 car (Ref: 30Nm) and a Hypercar (Ref: 60Nm) produce the same "internal" 1.0 signal when at their respective peaks, allowing the user's master\_gain to act as a consistent "Weight" control regardless of the car choice.2

### **Tire Load Normalization Logic (Tactile Effects)**

Tactile effects like RoadTexture should be scaled by the normalized tire load anchored to the static weight.

C++

float CalculateTactileScale(float currentLoad, float staticLoad) {  
    // 1\. Calculate ratio (Static Load Anchoring)  
    float loadRatio \= currentLoad / staticLoad;  
      
    // 2\. Soft-knee compression to prevent violent spikes at high speed  
    // This prevents 12,000N loads from being 3.4x stronger than static,  
    // which might be too violent for some transducers.  
    float compressedRatio \= std::log1p(loadRatio \- 1.0f) \+ 1.0f; // Logarithmic scaling  
      
    return std::clamp(compressedRatio, 0.0f, 3.0f);  
}

Using a logarithmic or "soft-knee" compression on the load ratio ensures that while the feeling of aero load is present, it does not become overwhelming or dangerous at 300 km/h, while still remaining perceptible at 50 km/h.25

## **Comparison of Wheelbase Capabilities and Normalization Needs**

The necessity for normalization is inversely proportional to the dynamic range of the hardware. A 25 Nm wheelbase has enough "headroom" to run many cars 1:1 without clipping.3 A 5 Nm wheelbase *must* use aggressive normalization to provide any usable detail.7

### **Wheelbase Torque and Normalization Requirements**

| Max Torque (Nm) | Representative Hardware | Normalization Strategy | Clipping Risk |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **2 \- 5 Nm** | Logitech G29, Thrustmaster T150 | Heavy Compression / Non-Linear Boost 12 | Extreme; 100% output is reached almost immediately. |
| **8 \- 12 Nm** | Fanatec CSL DD, Moza R9 | Linear with Peak Chasing 6 | High; Hypercars will clip without attenuation. |
| **15 \- 20 Nm** | ClubSport DD+, Simucube 2 Sport | Static Reference Mapping (1:1 focus) 7 | Moderate; only extreme cars (IndyCar) clip. |
| **25+ Nm** | Simucube 2 Pro/Ult, DD2 | Physics Passthrough (Linear Mode) 3 | Low; used for professional training. 7 |

For users with high-end Direct Drive bases (25+ Nm), the "normalization" might actually be a 1:1 passthrough for GT3 cars, but an attenuation for Hypercars.3 For a 5 Nm user, *every* car must be attenuated or compressed significantly to prevent the wheel from becoming a "on/off" switch.7

## **Human Factors: Fatigue and Reaction Times**

Research in professional sim racing indicates that "more torque" does not always equate to "faster lap times".43 Professional drivers like Bono Huis often run their FFB at lower settings than "realistic" values to reduce the physical resistance during rapid direction changes (e.g., chicanes at Imola).43

### **The "Bono Huis" Effect and Normalization**

Lower force feedback reduces the inertia of the system and the physical effort required for counter-steering, leading to faster reaction times.43 A normalization framework allows analytical drivers to set a consistent "Comfort Level" across all cars. If a driver prefers 10 Nm of sustained cornering torque for optimal fatigue management, the **Class-Aware Reference Mapping** allows them to achieve this exactly, whether they are in a GT3 or a Hypercar, by simply adjusting a single global gain.4

### **Safety Considerations**

High-torque wheelbases present physical risks during crashes.1 Normalization algorithms must include a "Crash Detection" sub-routine. When the torque exceeds a specific delta (![][image29]) or a threshold far beyond the ![][image6], the application should temporarily mute the output or engage a "Hard Limiter" to protect the user's wrists.5 This is especially critical when using "Linear Mode" on wheelbases capable of 25 Nm.12

## **Conclusions and Practical Recommendations**

The investigation into optimal normalization frameworks for telemetry-based FFB applications concludes that a multi-stage logic pipeline is necessary to balance consistency, fidelity, and safety.2

### **Summary of Optimal Frameworks**

1. **Steering Weight**: Implement **Class-Aware Reference Mapping** as the primary normalization method. This provides a stable baseline for each vehicle category (GT3: 30Nm, Hypercar: 50-60Nm). Supplement this with a **Session-Learned Peak Detector** that acts as a user-triggered "Auto" calibration to handle setup changes and track specifics.2  
2. **Tactile Effects**: Utilize **Static Load Anchoring** (Normalizing against corner weight at ![][image30]) to preserve the communicative sensation of aerodynamic downforce and speed. Apply a **Logarithmic or Soft-Knee compression** to the load ratio to ensure that haptic effects scale meaningfully without becoming physically overwhelming at high speeds.2  
3. **Signal Fidelity**: Use **Soft-Knee Compression** instead of hard clipping at the wheelbase's output limit. This allows for "Information Persistence" during high-load scenarios, where secondary details like road textures can still be felt "on top" of the primary steering torque.29  
4. **Signal Quality**: Implement **Smoothing Tau** (0.01s \- 0.04s) and jitter filtering on telemetry inputs to ensure that the normalization factors do not introduce digital artifacts. This is particularly vital for low-update-rate telemetry common in legacy physics engines.19

By integrating these mathematical and logic frameworks, the LMUFFB application (and similar telemetry-driven utilities) can provide a "transfusable" experience across vehicle classes. The driver gains a consistent, nuanced, and safe interface with the simulation, allowing them to focus on the performance and behavior of the car rather than struggling with the limitations of the haptic hardware.4
