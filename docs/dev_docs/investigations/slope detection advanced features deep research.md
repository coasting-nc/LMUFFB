# **Advanced Real-Time Estimation of Tire Friction and Cornering Dynamics within the isiMotor 2.5 Physics Environment**

The development of high-fidelity Force Feedback (FFB) systems for simulation platforms such as rFactor 2 and Le Mans Ultimate requires a sophisticated synthesis of tire physics, recursive estimation theory, and digital signal processing. At the core of these platforms is the isiMotor 2.5 engine, a complex architecture that utilizes a physically-based Tire Graphical Model (TGM) rather than the empirical "Magic Formula" models common in other simulators. To provide a driver with an accurate sensation of the tire-road interface, an FFB system must estimate the tire-road friction coefficient (![][image1]) and the instantaneous cornering stiffness (![][image2]) in real-time, often operating at frequencies between 400 Hz and 2400 Hz. This report investigates the robust algorithms required for these estimations, the specific transient behaviors of the isiMotor 2.5 engine, and the signal processing techniques necessary to isolate useful physics data from the high-frequency noise inherent in a racing environment.

## **The isiMotor 2.5 Tire Physics Framework**

To implement a robust estimation algorithm, one must first understand the data source. The isiMotor 2.5 TGM is a brush-based model that represents the tire as a series of independent bristles capable of localized interaction with the track surface. These bristles are integrated into a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) rigid ring structure that simulates the frequency modes and structural deformations of the tire carcass.

### **Structural Parameters and Stiffness Modulation**

The mechanical behavior of the virtual tire is governed by structural parameters defined in the TGM master files, which dictate how the tire generates forces in response to load and slip. These parameters are non-linear and time-varying, necessitating adaptive estimation techniques.

| Parameter Group | Key Variable | Physics Influence | Typical Range/Value |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Structural Stiffness** | BeltSpringX | Lateral (sidewall) compliance and phase lag. | ![][image3] |
| **Radial Compliance** | BeltSpringZ | Vertical stiffness and load sensitivity. | ![][image4] |
| **Grip Scaling** | StaticBaseCoefficient | The theoretical maximum ![][image1] in a non-sliding state. | 1.9 \- 3.9 |
| **Adhesion Transition** | StaticDiffusiveAdhesion | Controls the "snappiness" of the friction peak. | 0.75 \- 0.99 |
| **Thermal Dynamics** | StaticCurve | Temperature-dependent grip multipliers. | 250K \- 520K |

The TGM model allows for a high degree of fidelity, particularly in how the contact patch responds to rotational speeds. The recent transition from global centrifugal calculations to "point-based acceleration" in the Quasi-Static Analysis (QSA) model has significantly altered the high-speed stability of tires in rFactor 2\. This update results in a longer contact patch at high loads and speeds, which increases stability but also makes the tire more prone to overheating at the trailing edge of the patch due to increased sliding speed. Any estimation algorithm must therefore account for the fact that cornering stiffness is not a constant value but is influenced by velocity, load, and temperature.

### **Thermodynamic Influence on Cornering Stiffness**

The isiMotor 2.5 engine includes a detailed thermodynamic model that influences the friction coefficient. The StaticCurve defines three Kelvin temperature points and their corresponding grip multipliers. As the tire temperature moves outside its optimal window, the available friction coefficient drops, which directly impacts the slope of the Lateral Force vs. Slip Angle curve.

![][image5]  
For real-time estimation, this means the algorithm must be capable of tracking parameter drifts caused by thermal changes. This is where Recursive Least Squares (RLS) with forgetting factors becomes essential, as it allows the model to "forget" the behavior of a cold tire as the rubber reaches its operating temperature.

## **Mathematical Stability in Parametric Estimation**

The primary goal of friction estimation in FFB is to identify the slope of the lateral force curve before the tire reaches saturation. This slope, or cornering stiffness (![][image2]), is defined as:

![][image6]  
In a real-time environment, the algorithm must identify this parameter while handling the non-stationary nature of the system and the inherent noise in the telemetry data.

### **Recursive Least Squares with Variable Forgetting Factors**

The Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is preferred in automotive control because it minimizes a weighted linear least-squares cost function relating the input signals (Slip Angle) to the output signals (Lateral Force). The standard RLS update law is:

![][image7]  
where ![][image8] is the parameter vector (containing ![][image2]), ![][image9] is the gain vector, ![][image10] is the measured lateral force, and ![][image11] is the input vector containing slip angles.

The inclusion of a forgetting factor (![][image12]) allows the algorithm to weight recent data more heavily than older data. However, a fixed forgetting factor (FFF) presents a fundamental engineering trade-off: a ![][image12] close to 1.0 ensures stability and noise rejection but is too slow to track the rapid changes in grip encountered when a car hits a curb or grass; conversely, a ![][image12] significantly less than 1.0 (e.g., 0.95) tracks changes quickly but becomes highly sensitive to sensor noise and can lead to "estimator windup".

To resolve this, Variable Forgetting Factor (VFF) schemes adjust ![][image12] based on the prediction error ![][image13]. In the isiMotor 2.5 environment, where high-frequency vibrations from the road surface are constant, a robust VFF logic is required:

![][image14]  
where ![][image15] is a tuning parameter that determines the sensitivity to the error. This ensures that when the car experiences a sudden change in surface (large ![][image13]), the algorithm "forgets" the old surface quickly, but remains stable during steady-state cornering.

### **Addressing Excitation Loss and Singularities**

A critical failure point for RLS in sim racing is "excitation loss." This occurs during steady-state cornering on a constant radius, where the slip angle and lateral force derivatives approach zero. In these conditions, the algorithm lacks "rich" data to identify the parameters, and the covariance matrix ![][image16] in the RLS update law can grow exponentially, leading to numerical singularities and the "blow-up" of the estimated values.

To prevent this, FFB developers must implement techniques to handle poor excitation:

1. **Directional Forgetting:** Rather than a scalar ![][image12], forgetting is only applied to the directions in the parameter space where new information is available. If a driver is holding a constant steering angle, the algorithm should not "forget" the previously learned cornering stiffness, as no new data is contradicting it.  
2. **Conditional Update (Dead-Zone):** The parameter update is only executed when the excitation exceeds a predefined threshold, such as a minimum rate of change in slip angle (![][image17]). This prevents the estimator from trying to derive information from pure noise during static conditions.  
3. **Covariance Trace Resetting:** If the trace of the covariance matrix ![][image16] exceeds a safety limit, it is reset or regularized to prevent the gain ![][image9] from becoming too large.

### **Savitzky-Golay Filters for Slope Analysis**

While RLS is an adaptive model-based approach, the Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter is a non-recursive signal processing technique that can be used for "slope detection" by calculating the first derivative of the Lateral G vs. Slip Angle relationship. The SG filter fits a low-degree polynomial to a sliding window of data points using the method of linear least squares.

![][image18]  
where ![][image19] are pre-calculated convolution coefficients for the first derivative.

The primary advantage of the SG filter over a simple moving average or a first-order differentiator is its ability to smooth the signal while preserving the integrity of the peaks and the underlying signal tendency. In FFB applications, an SG filter is often used as a pre-processor for the raw telemetry stream, smoothing the lateral G and slip angle signals before they enter the RLS estimator. This reduces the "jitter" in the estimated ![][image2] that would otherwise be caused by high-frequency road textures.

| Feature | VFF-RLS | Savitzky-Golay |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Computational Model** | Recursive / Adaptive | Finite Impulse Response (FIR) |
| **Numerical Stability** | Prone to windup without logic | Inherently stable (no feedback loop) |
| **Transient Tracking** | Extremely fast (optimal for non-stationary) | Limited by window size (introduces lag) |
| **Implementation Complexity** | High (Matrix math, SVD, regularization) | Low (Static coefficients and convolution) |
| **Requirement** | Rich excitation | Evenly spaced data points |

## **Transient Dynamics and Phase Delay in isiMotor 2.5**

The isiMotor 2.5 engine's use of a 6-DOF rigid ring and bristle model introduces physical delays that are not present in simpler simulators. Understanding these delays is paramount for FFB developers who seek to align the tactile sensations with the visual cues.

### **Tire Relaxation Length and Build-up Lag**

"Relaxation length" refers to the distance a tire must roll to develop steady-state lateral force after a change in slip angle. In rFactor 2, this is not a single hard-coded parameter but an emergent behavior of the carcass stiffness (BeltSpringX) and the damping properties (TemporaryBristleDamper).

In low-speed corners, the relaxation length translates into a significant temporal delay, as the tire rolls slowly. This results in a phase lag between steering input and the generation of lateral G. Telemetry analysis of isiMotor 2.5 cars typically reveals a phase delay of approximately 10ms to 40ms, depending on the speed and the stiffness of the tire modeled. If the FFB torque is calculated purely based on the instantaneous lateral acceleration, the driver will feel a "numbness" or a "softness" during initial turn-in, as the force build-up in the simulation lags behind the driver's intention.

### **Hysteresis Compensation in Force Feedback**

To compensate for this build-up lag and the resulting hysteresis, FFB developers use a combination of leading and lagging indicators. While lateral G is a lagging indicator (force is already generated), variables related to the steering geometry, such as aligning torque and pneumatic trail, act as leading indicators.

Pneumatic trail is the distance between the center of the contact patch and the point where the lateral force is concentrated. As the tire reaches its limit, the pneumatic trail begins to decrease before the total lateral force peaks. By blending a signal derived from the change in steering arm force with the lateral G signal, FFB developers can create a "anticipatory" feel that warns the driver of impending grip loss before the car physically begins to understeer.

Furthermore, the "Quasi-Static Analysis" (QSA) process in the TGM model, which generates the look-up tables used in real-time, can be tuned with a DT (Delta Time) multiplier. A lower DT during the table generation phase in tTool leads to a more stable but potentially "slower" tire response, while a higher DT increases the reactivity but risks numerical instability and "spiky" force generation.

## **Signal Processing: Isolating Saturation from Noise**

The telemetry signals from isiMotor 2.5 are famously "raw," containing not just the macro-level vehicle dynamics but also the micro-level vibrations of the suspension, the "buzz" of road textures, and the impulsive shocks of curb strikes. Separating the "useful" tire saturation signal from this noise is a significant signal processing challenge.

### **Total Least Squares and Orthogonal Distance Regression**

A major limitation of standard RLS (Ordinary Least Squares) is the assumption that the input signal (Slip Angle) is perfectly known and only the output (Lateral G) contains noise. In a sim racing environment, both signals are contaminated with noise. Slip angle is derived from the vehicle's yaw rate and lateral velocity, both of which are subject to integration errors and sensor-like noise in the engine.

Total Least Squares (TLS), implemented via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), is a more robust alternative. TLS minimizes the orthogonal distance from the data points to the fitted line, accounting for errors in both variables.

For a C++ implementation in an FFB plugin, the TLS approach involves:

1. Maintaining a ring buffer of the last ![][image20] samples of ![][image21].  
2. Normalizing the data to remove DC offsets.  
3. Constructing a covariance matrix ![][image22].  
4. Applying SVD to ![][image22] to find the principal components.  
5. The slope of the line is then derived from the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest singular value.

This "Projected Slope" method provides a significantly more stable estimate of cornering stiffness when the car is vibrating over road textures, as the orthogonal minimization prevents the noise on the X-axis (Slip Angle) from biasing the slope estimate towards zero.

### **Curb Filtering and Slew Rate Management**

Curbs and road textures in isiMotor 2.5 often produce high-frequency vertical deflections that manifest as rapid spikes in the lateral acceleration channel. These spikes can cause "violent snaps" in high-end direct drive wheels, which can be physically dangerous or simply unrealistic.

To mitigate this without losing the "feel" of the road, developers employ a slew rate limiter or a non-linear compressor. A slew rate limiter constrains the maximum rate of change of the FFB signal (![][image23]), effectively acting as a low-pass filter that only activates during impulsive shocks. This allows the high-frequency road "buzz" to pass through at low amplitudes while "taming" the massive spikes caused by hitting a 3D curb at high speed.

## **Telemetry Proxies and the LMU Variable Shift**

A major point of technical debate for FFB and telemetry tool developers has been the availability of physics variables in Le Mans Ultimate (LMU). Historically, the mGripFract (approximation of what fraction of the contact patch is sliding) and mTireLoad variables were zeroed out in the legacy shared memory interface.

### **The LMU 1.2 "Zeroed-Out" Issue**

While the release of LMU update 1.2 and the accompanying SDK changes revised the InternalsPlugin.hpp header to explicitly include these fields, they remain non-functional in the current implementation.1 Developers have confirmed that the game consistently returns **zero (0)** for mGripFract and mTireLoad in the live data stream, despite their presence in the shared memory interface.1 This limitation is attributed to license agreements and specific implementation choices by the game developers.2

| Data Channel | Old Interface (Legacy) | New Interface (TelemWheelV01) | Actual LMU 1.2 Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Tire Load** | mTireLoad (0.0) | mTireLoad | **Always 0.0** 1 |
| **Grip Fraction** | mGripFract (0.0) | mGripFract | **Always 0.0** 1 |
| **Patch Velocity** | mLateralPatchVel | mLateralPatchVel | Available |
| **Torque** | mSteeringArmForce | mSteeringShaftTorque | Available |

### **Workaround Strategies for LMU FFB**

Because direct tire load and grip fraction data are currently unavailable, FFB plugin developers (such as those for the lmuFFB app) must utilize alternative estimation methods:

* **Suspension Telemetry Approximation:** Developers can derive an approximated tire load value using vertical suspension travel and spring rate telemetry, which remains accessible.1 However, this approximation is often considered less accurate than direct direct tire data for high-frequency FFB signals.1  
* **Aligning Torque Derivatives:** Monitoring the relationship between mSteeringShaftTorque and steering angle serves as the primary leading indicator for understeer detection.1

### **Contact Patch Velocity for Tactile Feedback**

The mLateralPatchVel variable remains functional and represents the speed at which the tire tread is scrubbing against the track surface. For FFB systems that include tactile transducers, this variable acts as the primary driver for "Slide Texture". By mapping the lateral patch velocity to a frequency generator, the FFB can provide a "gritty" vibration that increases in intensity as the tire slides more aggressively.

## **System Integration and Performance Optimization**

Implementing these robust algorithms requires careful consideration of the computational environment. The isiMotor 2.5 engine's physics thread typically runs at 400 Hz, but many FFB plugins attempt to interpolate or run their own estimation loops at much higher frequencies to reduce "stair-stepping" in the force output.

### **C++ Implementation Considerations**

A real-time FFB plugin must avoid any operations that could cause thread blocking. For RLS and TLS algorithms, this means using fixed-size matrices and optimized linear algebra libraries like Eigen or Armadillo, which can be compiled with SIMD instructions to ensure the estimation loop completes in under 0.5ms.

The use of SVD for Total Least Squares is computationally expensive. In a 2400 Hz FFB loop, even a ![][image24] SVD must be carefully implemented to avoid performance hits. Many developers choose to run the "heavy" parameter identification (RLS/TLS) on a separate thread at 100 Hz, while the FFB torque calculation uses the "latest known" cornering stiffness at the full 2400 Hz rate.

### **Handling Signal Artifacts**

The isiMotor 2.5 engine occasionally produces "periodic, high-frequency oscillations" that are not related to road texture but are artifacts of the physics solver's stability. These oscillations can cause an intermittent "buzz" in the steering wheel. Robust estimation algorithms must include a "validity check" on the estimated cornering stiffness: if ![][image2] jumps by more than a certain percentage between samples, or if it becomes negative (beyond the friction peak), the estimator should revert to a "fallback" nominal value derived from the car's TGM files to prevent a feedback loop that could damage the wheel hardware.

## **Conclusions and Future Outlook**

Robust tire friction estimation in the isiMotor 2.5 environment is a multi-layered problem that transitions from raw bristle-level physics to high-level adaptive signal processing. The investigation confirms that while Recursive Least Squares with Variable Forgetting Factors is the standard for tracking non-stationary grip levels, it must be shielded from excitation loss and road noise through conditional updates and Savitzky-Golay pre-filtering.

Despite updates to the LMU shared memory interface, the continued zeroing of mGripFract and mTireLoad means that developers must still rely on recursive observers or suspension-based proxies to estimate the tire's state. The ultimate success of an FFB system in this domain lies in its ability to reconcile the high-frequency chaos of the isiMotor physics engine into a coherent, tactile narrative that guides the driver toward the limit of performance.
