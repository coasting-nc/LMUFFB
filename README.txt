INSTALLATION & CONFIGURATION (LMU 1.2+)
---------------------------------------

Step-by-Step Setup:

A. Configure lmuFFB
   1. Run LMUFFB.exe
   2. FFB Device: In the dropdown, select your Physical Wheel 
      (e.g., "Simucube 2 Pro", "Fanatec DD1")
   3. Master Gain: Start low (0.5) and increase

B. Configure Le Mans Ultimate (LMU)
   1. Start LMU
   2. Go to Settings > Graphics:
      - Set Display Mode to "Borderless" (Prevents crashes/minimizing)
   
   3. Go to Controls > Force Feedback 
   4. Steering Axis: Bind to your Physical Wheel 
      (e.g., Simucube, Fanatec, Moza, Logitech)

   5. In-Game Force Feedback settings in LMU:
      - Disable FFB: set FFB Effects Off
      - FFB Strength: reduce to 0%

   6. Drive! You should feel force feedback generated by the app


EXPERIMENTAL VERSION - TESTING NEEDED!
--------------------------------------

This is an experimental release, the FFB formulas may require refinement 
based on real-world testing.

Please help us improve lmuFFB:
1. Test with caution - Start with low wheel strength settings
2. Experiment with settings - Try different effect combinations and gains
3. Share your results - Post screenshots (including the lmuFFB console and the "Graphs" window) to the LMU Forum Thread:
   https://community.lemansultimate.com/index.php?threads/irffb-for-lmu-lmuffb.10440/
4. Report issues - Let us know what works and what doesn't!

Your testing and feedback is greatly appreciated!


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Inverted FFB (Force pushes away from center):
  - If the FFB feels "backwards" or "inverted" while driving (wheel pushes 
    away from center instead of pulling toward it), check the "Invert FFB" 
    checkbox in the lmuFFB GUI
  - This reverses the force direction to match your wheel's expected behavior


No FFB:
  - Ensure the "FFB Device" in lmuFFB is your real wheel
  - Check if Connected to Le Mans Ultimate" appear in the GUI
  - Verify the FFB strength in your device driver is not too low
  - Increase Master Gain or reduce Max Torque Ref
  - Check the lmuFFB console for errors


UPCOMING FEATURES
-----------------

* Basic mode with only main sliders and auto adjustment of other settings
* Adaptive Optimal Slip Angle
* Wet Weather Haptics (Hydro-Grain): vibration cues telling when the tires 
  are on dry or wet surface, and if there is grip or not
* Per wheel Hydro-Grain to give information about a drying racing line 
  (e.g., left tires on dry, right tires on wet)
* Longitudinal Dynamic Weight Transfer: feeling of the car getting heavy 
  under braking and light under acceleration

===============================================================================
RFACTOR 2 COMPATIBILITY
===============================================================================

Note: rFactor 2 is NOT SUPPORTED in v0.4.0+. For rFactor 2, please use 
earlier versions of lmuFFB (v0.3.x). See the releases page for v0.3.x 
downloads:
https://github.com/coasting-nc/LMUFFB/releases

rF2 will be supported again in a future version, in particular to compare 
our grip approximation algorithm with the real values returned by the game 
for non DLC cars.
