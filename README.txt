INSTALLATION & CONFIGURATION (LMU 1.2+)
---------------------------------------

Step-by-Step Setup:

A. Configure lmuFFB
   1. Run LMUFFB.exe
   2. FFB Device: In the dropdown, select your Physical Wheel 
      (e.g., "Simucube 2 Pro", "Fanatec DD1")
   3. Master Gain: Start low (0.5) and increase

B. Configure Le Mans Ultimate (LMU)
   1. Start LMU
   2. Go to Settings > Graphics:
      - Set Display Mode to "Borderless" (Prevents crashes/minimizing)
   
   3. Go to Controls > Force Feedback 
   4. Steering Axis: Bind to your Physical Wheel 
      (e.g., Simucube, Fanatec, Moza, Logitech)

   5. In-Game Force Feedback settings in LMU:
      - Disable FFB: set FFB Effects Off
      - FFB Strength: reduce to 0%

   6. Drive! You should feel force feedback generated by the app


EXPERIMENTAL VERSION - TESTING NEEDED!
--------------------------------------

This is an experimental release, the FFB formulas may require refinement 
based on real-world testing.

Please help us improve lmuFFB:
1. Test with caution - Start with low wheel strength settings
2. Experiment with settings - Try different effect combinations and gains
3. Share your results - Post screenshots (including the lmuFFB console and the "Graphs" window) to the LMU Forum Thread:
   https://community.lemansultimate.com/index.php?threads/lmuffb-app.10440/
4. Report issues - Let us know what works and what doesn't!

Your testing and feedback is greatly appreciated!


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Inverted FFB (Force pushes away from center):
  - If the FFB feels "backwards" or "inverted" while driving (wheel pushes 
    away from center instead of pulling toward it), check the "Invert FFB" 
    checkbox in the lmuFFB GUI
  - This reverses the force direction to match your wheel's expected behavior

No FFB:
  - Ensure the "FFB Device" in lmuFFB is your real wheel
  - Check if Connected to Le Mans Ultimate" appear in the GUI
  - Verify the FFB strength in your device driver is not too low
  - Increase Master Gain or reduce Max Torque Ref
  - Check the lmuFFB console for errors

Baseline vibration from the FFB:
  - That is known to come from the Steering Shaft Torque from the game (you can temporarily disable Steering Shaft Gain to confirm it)
  - To fix it, enable the "Static Noise Filter" in lmuFFB and set a Target Frequency of 10-12 Hz
  - If some noise is still present, you can increase the Steering Shaft Smoothing.

Steering wheel bouncing/shaking when stationary (engine vibration):
  - If your wheel "bounces around on the tune of the engine rpm" when the car 
    is stopped or idling, this is caused by the game's engine vibration physics 
    being transmitted through the steering column
  - Automatic Fix (v0.6.22+): This is now automatically handled by the Automatic 
    Idle Smoothing feature. The vibration should fade out when you're stationary 
    and return to normal when driving
  - Manual Workaround (older versions): Go to Signal Filtering, enable Static 
    Noise Filter, and set the frequency to 10-15 Hz. Adjust until the bouncing 
    stops. This will surgically remove the engine bounce without making the 
    steering feel light

FFB too weak:
  - Increase Master Gain
  - Or reduce Max Torque Ref (this amplifies the signal by setting a lower reference point for maximum torque)

Strange pull in some scenarios:
  - If you feel a strange pull in specific driving situations, try reducing the Rear Align Torque
  
The app has too many options and it's confusing:
  - A future version will include a "Basic Mode" with auto adjustment and defaults for most settings.
  - We need to first determine which settings work best for most users and wheel types (Direct Drive vs Belt/Gear).
  - Please leave feedback on the forum thread telling us what settings work best for you:
    https://community.lemansultimate.com/index.php?threads/lmuffb-app.10440/

Any other issue:
  - Report it in the thread in the LMU forum to get support and get the app updated:
    https://community.lemansultimate.com/index.php?threads/lmuffb-app.10440/
  - Important: You can help significantly by taking a screenshot (use the "Save Screenshot" button in the app) and pasting it into your forum post. This captures all your settings and the console log in one go.

UPCOMING FEATURES
-----------------

* Basic mode with only main sliders and auto adjustment of other settings
* Adaptive Optimal Slip Angle
* Wet Weather Haptics (Hydro-Grain): vibration cues telling when the tires 
  are on dry or wet surface, and if there is grip or not
* Per wheel Hydro-Grain to give information about a drying racing line 
  (e.g., left tires on dry, right tires on wet)
* Longitudinal Dynamic Weight Transfer: feeling of the car getting heavy 
  under braking and light under acceleration

===============================================================================
RFACTOR 2 COMPATIBILITY
===============================================================================

Note: rFactor 2 is NOT SUPPORTED in v0.4.0+. For rFactor 2, please use 
earlier versions of lmuFFB (v0.3.x). See the releases page for v0.3.x 
downloads:
https://github.com/coasting-nc/LMUFFB/releases

rF2 will be supported again in a future version, in particular to compare 
our grip approximation algorithm with the real values returned by the game 
for non DLC cars.
