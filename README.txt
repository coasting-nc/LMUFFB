lmuFFB - Le Mans Ultimate Force Feedback
========================================
Version: 0.3.7

See README.md for full documentation with images and links.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
1. vJoy Driver (Version 2.1.9.1 recommended)
   Download: https://github.com/jshafer817/vJoy/releases
   
   Why vJoy? LMU needs a "dummy" device to bind steering to, so it doesn't 
   try to send its own FFB to your real wheel while lmuFFB is controlling it.
   
   Configuration:
   - Open "Configure vJoy" tool
   - Set up Device 1 with at least X Axis enabled
   - Disable all vJoy FFB Effects EXCEPT "Constant Force"
   - Click Apply

2. rF2 Shared Memory Plugin (rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll)
   Download from one of these sources:
   - https://github.com/TheIronWolfModding/rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin#download
   - Bundled with CrewChief: https://thecrewchief.org/
   
   Installation:
   - Copy rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll to "Le Mans Ultimate/Plugins/" folder
   - Note: LMU does not have an in-game menu to enable plugins. It is enabled 
     automatically if the file is present.

3. vJoyInterface.dll (Required for lmuFFB to run)
   This DLL MUST be in the same folder as LMUFFB.exe
   
   Download from:
   - C:\Program Files\vJoy\SDK\lib\amd64\ (if you installed vJoy SDK)
   - https://github.com/shauleiz/vJoy/tree/master/SDK/lib/amd64/vJoyInterface.dll


STEP-BY-STEP SETUP
------------------

A. Configure Le Mans Ultimate (LMU)
   1. Start LMU
   2. Go to Settings > Graphics:
      - Set Display Mode to "Borderless" (Prevents crashes/minimizing)
   
   3. Go to Controls / Bindings
   4. Steering Axis - Choose ONE method:
      
      METHOD A (Direct - Recommended):
      Step-by-Step Setup:
      1. Clean Slate: Close Joystick Gremlin and vJoy Feeder if running
      2. Game Setup:
         - Start Le Mans Ultimate
         - Bind Steering directly to your Physical Wheel 
           (e.g., Simucube, Fanatec, Moza, Logitech)
         - IMPORTANT: Set In-Game FFB Strength to 0% (or "Off")
      3. App Setup:
         - Start LMUFFB
         - CRITICAL STEP: In the LMUFFB window, find the "FFB Device" dropdown
         - Click it and select your Physical Wheel from the list
         - Note: You MUST do this manually. If it says "Select Device...", 
           the app is calculating forces but sending them nowhere
      4. Verify:
         - Check the console for errors. If you select your wheel and do NOT 
           see a red error like "[DI] Failed to acquire", then it is connected!
         - Drive the car. You should feel the physics-based FFB
      
      Troubleshooting - No FFB:
      - Check Console Messages: While driving, look for "[DI Warning] Device 
        unavailable" repeating in the console
        * YES, I see the warning: The game has 'Locked' your wheel in Exclusive 
          Mode. You cannot use the Direct Method. You must use Method B (vJoy Bridge)
        * NO, console is clean: The game might be overwriting the signal. Try 
          Alt-Tabbing out of the game. If FFB suddenly kicks in when the game 
          is in the background, it confirms the game is interfering. Use Method B
      - Try Adjusting Settings: If you feel no FFB, try tweaking these values:
        * Master Gain: Increase from 0.5 to 1.0 or higher
        * SOP (Seat of Pants): Increase from 0.0 to 0.3 (feel lateral forces)
        * Understeer Effect: Ensure it's at 1.0 (default)
      
      Pros: Simplest setup. No vJoy required
      Cons: If wheel has no FFB, try Method B
      
      METHOD B (vJoy Bridge - Compatibility):
      - Bind to "vJoy Device (Axis Y)"
      - IMPORTANT: You MUST use "Joystick Gremlin" to map your wheel to vJoy Axis Y.
      - Why? Guarantees separation of FFB and Input.
   
   5. Force Feedback Settings:
      - Type: Set to "None" (if available) or reduce FFB Strength to 0% / Off
      - Note: LMU may not have a "None" option; reducing strength to 0 is 
        the workaround.
      - Effects: Set "Force Feedback Effects" to Off
      - Smoothing: Set to 0 (Raw) for fastest telemetry updates
      - Advanced: Set Collision Strength and Torque Sensitivity to 0%
      - Tweaks: Disable "Use Constant Steering Force Effect"

B. Configure lmuFFB (The App)
   1. Run LMUFFB.exe
   2. FFB Device: Select your Physical Wheel (e.g., "Simucube 2 Pro", "Fanatec DD1")
      - Do NOT select the vJoy device here
   3. Master Gain: Start low (0.5) and increase gradually
   4. SOP Effect: Start at 0.0
      - This effect injects lateral G-force
      - On High-Torque wheels (DD), this can cause violent oscillation if too high
   5. Drive! You should feel force feedback generated by the app


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Wheel Jerking / Fighting:
  - You likely have a "Double FFB" conflict
  - Ensure LMU Steering is bound to vJoy, NOT your real wheel
  - Ensure LMU FFB is sending to vJoy (or disabled/strength at 0)
  - If the wheel oscillates on straights, reduce SOP Effect to 0.0

No Steering (Car won't turn):
  - If using Method B (vJoy), you need Joystick Gremlin running
  - Ensure it maps your wheel to vJoy Axis Y
  - The "vJoy Demo Feeder" is for testing only, not driving

No FFB:
  - Ensure "FFB Device" in lmuFFB is your real wheel
  - Check if Shared Memory Plugin is working (console should show "Connected")
  - Verify the plugin DLL is in Le Mans Ultimate/Plugins/ folder

"vJoyInterface.dll not found":
  - Copy vJoyInterface.dll to the same folder as LMUFFB.exe
  - Get it from: C:\Program Files\vJoy\SDK\lib\amd64\
  - Or download: https://github.com/shauleiz/vJoy/tree/master/SDK/lib/amd64/vJoyInterface.dll

"Could not open file mapping object":
  - Start LMU and load a track first
  - The Shared Memory Plugin only activates when driving


KNOWN ISSUES (v0.3.7)
---------------------
- Telemetry Gaps: Some users report missing telemetry for Dashboard apps 
  (ERS, Temps). lmuFFB has robust fallbacks, but if Tire Temperature data 
  is broken, the Understeer effect may be static.
