# A change log file, keeping track of every release or commit.

# When starting the app, if the game is not running, this error gets printed in the terminal: 
# Starting LMUFFB (C++ Port)...
# Could not open file mapping object. Ensure game is running.
# I want this error to be displayed as a GUI pop up (if GUI is enabled)

# I want a save button for the FFB configuration sliders. Save those to a text file (json or txt).
# Also add a reset to defaults button (the initial settings of the app)
